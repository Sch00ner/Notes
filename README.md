# Notes
**Notes for law school.**
An easy way for my notes to be portable and readable from any device. Take these notes to only be an *indicative outline* of what to study.

## How to get started
I take notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Just go to the [site](https://obsidian.md/download) and install it to get started. If you need help with anything, the official [docs](https://help.obsidian.md/) have got your back. Or, ask the [community](https://obsidian.md/community)!
