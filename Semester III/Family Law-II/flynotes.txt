Father claimed that the property given to the son was not his individual property, but that of the HUF composed of him and his son. Court ruled that as the sole coparcener, he had absolute control over the property and thus the HUF could not in any real way be said to have owned it.

Rights of Coparceners
-Right by birth in the property.
-Right of common ownership.
-Right of common enjoyment of the property.
-Absence of a coparcener does not exclude their right in the property.
-Right of Survivorship.
-No right to alienation of undivided interest.
-Right to accounts.
-Can Segregate his joint and personal property.
-Blending his separate property into the joint property. This is an irrevocable act.
-Right to ask for partition. A minor cannot seek partition by themselves, they have to use their next friend as a proxy. Since, the Karta is not going to take the next friend seriously, the minor has to go to court along with their next friend. However, the court will look at the best interest of the minor and if the Karta is taking care of such minor sufficiently, the court will not grant such partition. If the partition is granted, a guardian will be appointed for the minor and the property so partitioned.
-Right to renounce his interest. Becomes a Sanyasi. Gives up the right to his share of the joint family property. If he is renouncing his interest, he can also seek maintenace from the joint family property. Any children born after such renunciation will not get a share in the joint family property. But if the mother was pregnant at the time of renunciation, the child will retain his share. Any existing children will also retain their share.
-Right to acquire gives the coparcener the right to acquire property in his private capacity, separate from the joint family property.
-Right to restrain improper acts.
-Right to alienaion. Cannot alienate undivided share before partition. Difference is in the Bombay, Madras and J&K school, where you did not need the consent of other coparceners to mortgage their undivided share. In other areas, undivided share could not be transacted with.
-Right to challenge an unauthorised alienation. A Karta can only alienate joint family property for certain reasons:
	1.To pay for legal costs.
	2.For the benefit of estate.
	3.Performance of religious or charitable duties.
Any alienation for reasons except for the above, will be considered unauthorised alienation. In Sushil Kumar v Ram Prakash AIR 1988 SC 576, it was held that a coparcener cannot alienate his undivided share by way of gift, unless the other coparceners consent or if it is a small portion in favour of his daughter and/or sister. To alienate by Will, one has to be the sole surviving coparcener between the making of the Will and its execution. Post 1956, a coparcener is competent to make a valid Will, with respect to his undivided share of joint family property. Section 30 has been added to the HSA which makes the procedure of execution of a Will similar to the Indian Succession Act, post 1956. Remedies for coparceners include:
	1.A coparcener can ask for partition and separate from the joint family before the Karta alienates the joint family property.
	2.An injunction can be obtained from the court against such alienation if it is seen as wasteful or as an ouster.
	3.If the property is already alienated, the coparceners can challenge that such alienation is invalid and not binding on their shares. The burden of such proof will rest on the alienee to prove that the Karta was authorised to sell the family. But, if the father alienates it to pay antecedent debts and the son claims that such alienation is not binding, the son has to show that such debt was incurred for illegal or immoral purposes and the creditor also had notice of such illegality or immorality.
