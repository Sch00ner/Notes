-Post 1976, Hindus marrying under the SMA will not be deprived of HUF memebership if they opt for Hindu Succession Act.(Maneka Gandhi amendment)

4.7.20

Coparcenaries
-Consists of 4 generations on each side.
-Prior to 2005, only the male members are coparceners. After 2005, even the female members are coparceners. But, the wives of male members are not coparceners in the family of their husband, they will be coparceners in the family of their parents.
-Other members of the joint family apart from coparceners have a right of maintenance and residence upon the joint family property. They are not involved in managing the property, but they still have a right as and when partition happens.

-Membership of a joint family member can be lost by way of conversion, given away for adoption or a daughter who gets married.
-After 2000, a Hindu can adopt a child of any religion.

Presumption of Jointness
-Burden of proof is on the petitioner to show that a family is no longer a joint family.
-Joint residence is not required to be a joint Hindu Family

Joint Hindu Family Property
-Commissioner of Income Tax v Gomedalli Lakshminarayan
-No presumption that a Joint Hindu Family possesses joint property or any property at all.
-Movable property bought with the share of profits from the joint family property, does not become joint family property. But, immovable property b always becomes joint family property.

7.7.20

When there is only sole male member
-No benefits of tax exemption
-Treated as an individual and not as a HUF
-Even if all the property is purely ancestral, it's still an individual household

When there are only female members
-Sandhyarani Judgement: Father had died who was karta, leaving behind daughter and wife. Wife wanted to continue as HUF. Court said women can't be karta, start or continue a HUF without a male member.
-After 1956, Hindu women whether married, single or widowed could adopt children under HAMA.
-For the purposes of income tax, a mother can be assessed as the head of a HUF.

8.7.20

When there is only husband and wife
-TS Srinivasan v Commissioner Income Tax: A HUF is only created upon the birth of a son. Later overturned in the SC case of Surjit Lal.
-Seth Tulsidas Bolumal v Commissioner Income Tax: Father and son take half share of property. Father claimed that the property given to the son was not his individual property, but that of the HUF composed of him and his son. Court ruled that as the sole coparcener, he had absolute control over the property and thus the HUF could not in any real way be said to have owned it.
-If a family comprises of a man, his wife and daughter(s), it cannot be said that the property held by that man is the property of the HUF instead of personal property even if all of it was personal property.
-Surjit Lal v Commissioner of Income Tax: There cannot be any joint family comprising of a man, his wife and daughter(s).
-Sujata Sharama v Manu Gupta: Said no restrictions against female Karta under Sec.6 of the HSA.

15.7.20

Distinction between Joint Family and Coparcenary
-Joint family has no generation limit. But, coparcenary is limited to 4 generations.
-Disqualified coparceners are members of the joint family but not included in the coparcenary.
-Kamalkanta Mohapatra v Pratap Chandra Mohapatra

Rights of Coparceners
-Right by birth in the property.
-Right of common ownership.
-Right of common enjoyment of the property.
-Absence of a coparcener does not exclude their right in the property.
-Right of Survivorship.
-No right to alienation of undivided interest.
-Right to accounts.
-Can Segregate his joint and personal property.
-Blending his separate property into the joint property. This is an irrevocable act.
-Right to ask for partition. A minor cannot seek partition by themselves, they have to use their next friend as a proxy. Since, the Karta is not going to take the next friend seriously, the minor has to go to court along with their next friend. However, the court will look at the best interest of the minor and if the Karta is taking care of such minor sufficiently, the court will not grant such partition. If the partition is granted, a guardian will be appointed for the minor and the property so partitioned.
-Right to renounce his interest. Becomes a Sanyasi. Gives up the right to his share of the joint family property. If he is renouncing his interest, he can also seek maintenace from the joint family property. Any children born after such renunciation will not get a share in the joint family property. But if the mother was pregnant at the time of renunciation, the child will retain his share. Any existing children will also retain their share.
-Right to acquire gives the coparcener the right to acquire property in his private capacity, separate from the joint family property.
-Right to restrain improper acts.
-Right to alienaion. Cannot alienate undivided share before partition. Difference is in the Bombay, Madras and J&K school, where you did not need the consent of other coparceners to mortgage their undivided share. In other areas, undivided share could not be transacted with.
-Right to challenge an unauthorised alienation. A Karta can only alienate joint family property for certain reasons:
	1.To pay for legal costs.
	2.For the benefit of estate.
	3.Performance of religious or charitable duties.
Any alienation for reasons except for the above, will be considered unauthorised alienation. In Sushil Kumar v Ram Prakash AIR 1988 SC 576, it was held that a coparcener cannot alienate his undivided share by way of gift, unless the other coparceners consent or if it is a small portion in favour of his daughter and/or sister. To alienate by Will, one has to be the sole surviving coparcener between the making of the Will and its execution. Post 1956, a coparcener is competent to make a valid Will, with respect to his undivided share of joint family property. Section 30 has been added to the HSA which makes the procedure of execution of a Will similar to the Indian Succession Act, post 1956. Remedies for coparceners include:
	1.A coparcener can ask for partition and separate from the joint family before the Karta alienates the joint family property.
	2.An injunction can be obtained from the court against such alienation if it is seen as wasteful or as an ouster.
	3.If the property is already alienated, the coparceners can challenge that such alienation is invalid and not binding on their shares. The burden of such proof will rest on the alienee to prove that the Karta was authorised to sell the family. But, if the father alienates it to pay antecedent debts and the son claims that such alienation is not binding, the son has to show that such debt was incurred for illegal or immoral purposes and the creditor also had notice of such illegality or immorality.

22.7.20

-Separate property of a Hindu male when passed down to their son, it becomes ancestral property with respect to the son's son.
-If a Hindu male dies without any direct heirs, the male descendant who gets the property will hold it as a separate property even with respect to his own male descendants.
-Property inherited from a maternal grandfather is not deemed ancestral property.

Chelikani Venkayyamma Guru v Chelikani Venkatramanayyamma
-Held that property inherited from the maternal grandfather is ancestral property with accompanying rights of survivorship.
-Widow claimed a portion of this property after one of the brothers died.
-This decision was wrong in the light of Vijanneshwara's classification of property.

Muhammad Hussain Khan v Babu Kishva Nandan Sahai
-Property inherited from a maternal grandfather would be the grandson's separate property.
-This overruled Chelkani Venkayyamma.

-Property that a Hindu male inherits from any other relation apart from his three immediate paternal ancestors in the male line, will be obstructed heritage and count as his separate property.
-Property inherited from a female will also always be their separate property.
-The above two points are not applicable after 1956.

-Executing a Will does not affect the ownership or possession of a property during the lifetime of the testator.
-A Gift however, immediately changes the status of the property. It cannot be revoked unless it's a conditional gift and the gift becomes the separate property of the giftee.

C.N. Arunachalam v C.A. Murugantha Mudaliar
-Any property that is passed by Will to the son is to be counted as a separate property unless the Will intends otherwise.
-It will be determined on the contents of the Will and the class of beneficiaries it distributes property to.
-It has to be seen whether the Will hews close to normal devolution of property. Thus, the purpose of the Will, in this case, would be to leave no room for dispute after his death instead of a special allocation of property.

24.7.20

Property inherited from fathe under HSA
-Such property is the exclusive separate property of this son.
-This has been affirmed by many judgements with only one Gujarat judgement going against it.
-The son's male issue can't restrain him from doing what he wants with this property.
 
 CWT v Chander Sen
 -Judgement reaffirmed in Commissioner of Income Tax v Karuppan Chettiar.
 -Read it from slide.

Gaurav Sikri v Kaushalya Sikri
-Intestate dies leaving behind widow, three sons and a married daughter.
-All the kids executed a release deed for the property in favour of theri mother relinquishing all rights in the property to her favour.
-The estranged wife and two male children of one son claimed the share in the intestate's property.
-Rejecting their claim, the court said that only the sons, daugfhter and widow had the right to inherit property. The son's sons and his estranged wife had no claim during the lifetime of the son.
-CWT v Chander Sen was cited in this case, where it was decided that Hindu male heirs include a son and the son of a predeceased son and not sons of a living son.

Makhan Singh v Kulwant Singh
-Father died leaving behind eleven acres of land. The question was if the property was seperate or joint family property?
-It was held to be joint family property.

Ass Kaur v Kartar Singh
-SB Sinha and Markandey Katju in this case clearly erred and classified such property as joint property.
-Their reasoning was that since the father is an ancestor, it should be joint family property.

Conversion of Seperate Property into Joint Family Property.
-A coparcener can blend his own seperate property into the joint family property by specifically intending to do so.
-If joint family property does not exist, a person can declare his own seperate property to be joint family property.
-Intention to abandon seperate claim must be clearly established in order to convert it into joint family property.
-If one's seperate property is declared as joint family property for tax purposes, there is a difference of opinion as to whether it becomes joint family property or not. The AP HC thinks it is not conclusive, but the Bombay and Madras HC have ruled that this is final and it becomes joint family property.

25.7.20

Property acquired with aid of Joint Family Property
-Generally, property acquired with joint family funds or to the detriment of joint family property would take the character of joint family property.
-Where total investment comes from the joint family property, any property or profit acquired due to the use of such funds would accrue to the corpus of the joint family property, even if the investor's skill was required for such investment.
-If the joint family property is temporarily used or takes a loan from the joint family corpus, the property so acquired would be the  separate property of the person only if hemanages to pay back the joint family property.
-If both separate property and joint family property is used, usually the property so acquired would still be a joint family property.
-If a separate property is improved with joint family funds, it will take on the character of a joint family property.
-Several examples to be read from slides

Improvement of Joint Family Property by Separate Property
-If a coparcener uses his separate property to improve the joint family property, the separate property would be blended with the joint family property.
-Has to be compared to the case of Kuruppan Chettiar.

Doctrine of Accretion
-Savings and profits from joint family property would be part of the joint family property.
-However, if the Karta gives money to a person for maintenance or if there is a profit-sharing arrangement between family members, it will be counted as separate property if such money is reinvested and would not be merged into the joint family corpus.

Burden of Proof and Sufficiency of Nucleus
-Burden of proof to show that a property held by a family member is joint family property is on the one alleging such.
-However, if the nucleus is sufficient to have acquired the property held by the family member, the burden shifts to the member so accused.

-This case gave conditions when a junior meber can fill the role of Karta.-Read it from the slides.

29.7.20

Alienation of Joint Family Property
-Karta is entrusted with management. However, he does not own the whole property.
-Can be authorised by coparceners to sell their share of the property and it will be binding on the coparceners.
-According to Dharmashastra, warns against indiscriminate alienation as property is a bulwark against bad times.
-Vijaneshwara brings up three situation in which alienation is recommended:
	1.Apatkale - When an emergency is faced by the family or any memberof the family.
	2.Kutumbarthe - For the benefit of family members, such as their maintenance.
	3.Dharmarthe - For pious or religious purposes, such as funeral arrangements.

Authorisation of Alienaton
-When all coparceners are major and they consent to alienation, this is express authorisation.
-When any of the three situations above are the reason for alienation, it is considered as judicial authorisation.
-If it falls into any of these three categories, the Karta does not need the consent of the coparceners and doesn't even need to inform them.
-An injunction against such transfer under the three categories, can be challenged by coparceners and only if they manage to establish the inadequacy of the reason, an injunction can be issued. However, in case of waste or ouster, an injunction can be granted.

Remedy for Coparceners who don't agree to Alienation
-A coparcener may ask for his share before the transaction has happened. As soon as the coparcener expresses his wish for partition, the Karta cannot touch this coparcener's share.
-After the transaction, coparceners can challenge the validty of the transfer in a court on the ground that the transfer did not satisfy any of the three reasons. If the transfer is found to be without proper authorisation/reason, the transfer would be ruled void and the alienee is ordered to give the property back.

Requirement for legal necessity of Alienation
-Existence of a need or purpose.
-The requirement is lawful.
-No alternative source of income.
-Karta acts like any ordinary prudent person.

-Post 1956, HSA was in force.

5.8.20

Partition
-Expenses for the daughter has to be set aside during partition.
-No partition can be possible in case of a sole coparcener.

-Doctrine of Owelty: Coparceners have to pay the difference to each other. For the indivisible property that has been allotted to one coparcener only.
-For staircases and other traversable property, a right of easement can be granted.
-Temples and idols can have an arrangement where coparceners are allowed a specific period to worship.
-Partition follows a set of rules:
	1.Previous enjoyment irrelevant- It doesn't matter if a property was exclusively used by only one coparcener.
	2.Compulsory common enjoyment- Like the staircase and temple mentioned above.
	3.Balancing corresponding values of properties- This is where Doctrine of Owelty applies.
	4.Sale of Impartible Property-  Where no agreement can be reached on a particular piece of property, it can be sold and the cash proceeds distributed evenly.

Consequences of Partition
-Hindu male becomes an individual with a fixed share which he has exclusive control of.
-Read from slides

Minor Coparcener
-Aryan Kamal Wadhwa v Biharilal Wadhwa: An estranged wife asked for partition on behalf of her son. The family was ready to maintain the son out of the joint family property, so the court declined to enforce partition.
-Kakamanu Pedasubhayya v Kakamanu Akkamma: Since, the father was young, the court reasoned that he may get married again and have a new family which would make him unable to take care of this son. So, a partition was called for and the proceeds invested in a nationalised bank.
