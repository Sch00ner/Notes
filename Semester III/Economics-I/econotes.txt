Difference between Price and Value.
-Value is set by an individual. It can change over time and circumstances. Value is more fundamental to the individual.
-Price is set by an institution, i.e., the market. The interaction betwenn supply and demand sets the price. Price can be manipulated.

Microeconomics is an optimisation problem. A balance between available resources and generating satisfaction.

Developmental economics in the vein of Amartya Sen.
-Developing a skillset.
-Developing your own thoughts without external interference.
-Access to healthcare.
-Access to income.

Axiom of Completeness

Axiom of Transitivity
-If A>B and B>C, then A>C

Axiom of Non-satiety
-If bundle 1 contains more of at least one fruit and no less of the other fruit, then bundle 1 will be preferable to bundle 2.
-If bundle 1 has 5 oranges and 10 apples and bundle 2 contains 5 apples and 8 apples, bundle 1 is always better.

Axiom of Convexity
-Variety is better than extremes.
-Bundle 1 has only oranges, Bundle 2 has only apples, Bundle 3 has a mix of apples and oranges. Thus, Bundle 3 will be preferred.

What is a function?
-Mathematical representation of the relationship between variables, which are independent or dependent of each other.

Indifference curves
-Same utility value along the curve.
-Maps to the Axiom of Convexity, variety is prized.

-The marginal rate of substitution is the absolute value of the indifference curve.(https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/leibniz-03-02-01.html)

10.7.20

Interaction between two indifference maps
- Contract curve shows the economic efficiency of the interacting indifference maps.
-MRS (of person 1)=MRS (of person 2). This is the equation for the contract curve.

-Different schools of thought in microeconomics.
-Any policy adopted will be evaluated differently by the different schools of microeconomics.
-The market consists of both demand and supply sides. The industry will only be on the supply side.
-Alfred Marshall propounded the Cardinal Utility theory.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility)
-Cardinal Utility doesn't allow us to find marginal values, so it's not really useful to find preference gradients.

-The corporate tax cuts in India was promised to bring about increased demand in the market. However, there is a constraint on the demand side. So, the whole point of surge in demand was irrelevant.
-Most capital intensive industries had a lot of inventory left over because the demand was too weak. So, this was just a transfer of wealth from the rich to the poor.
-Before 2012, the Indian car market was dominated by hatchbacks and sedans. City commuters had a real love for sedans, the urban middle class saw it as a sign of status.
-SUVs at this time had a body on frame of construction method. They were also quite expensive, around Rs.35-40 lakhs. They had bad handling and a bumpy ride.
-Ford EcoSport came in and revolutionised the market. It had a high ground clearance, comfortable ride and good handling. It had a monocoque frame. It wasn't as good at off-roading as the body on frame SUVs though.
-The EcoSport was a risky bet because sedans and body on frame SUVs dominated the market at the time around this price point. So, Ford had to do market analysis and take into account consumer preferences.
-Market analysis was the first thing that Ford did. The second thing they needed to take care of was the cost of making the EcoSport. The engine was imported from Germany and pushed its price up by at least a lakh. Thus, Ford was inclined to do a lot of political lobbying to get the import costs down or consider manufacturing the engine in India itself.
-Ford came up with a new engine factory in India and replaced the German engine with a homemade one, bringing down the cost.
-Ford even stuck useless daytime running lights on the EcoSport to make it more attractive to consumers.
-In an oligopolic market it matters how the oligopolist reacts to price changes in other products and how to differentiate your product from other ones.
-Profit maximisation is a decent but insufficient theory to explain the behaviour of MNCs. Profit cannot be maximised unless employees can be perfectly tracked and measured. Thus, it is in the employer's incentive to motivate the employees to work as best as they can of their own volition.

-The demand curve of apple can be demonstrated by asking how much I'm willing to pay for an extra apple, when I already have 6 apples or so.
-When apples are cheaper than oranges, due to the substitution effect, consumers have an incentive to replace oranges and apples.
-Because of the substitution effect demand will always have an inverse relation to price.
-Since, the price of apples is cheaper, your real income is higher than before when there is a fall in price of either oranges or apples.
-However, if there is an increase in real income and the consumer was constrained to only buying jowar/bajra before this increase, he may now go ahead and buy wheat instead of increasing his consumption of jowar/bajra. This is the income effect.
-The minimum willingnes of a seller to produce another unit of the product. In a perfectly competitive market is the marginal cost of production.
-When the input price of production decreases,it will shift the supply curve towards the right because the supplier is willing to produce more apples.
-Another reason for the supply curve to shift is a change in technology. If the production technology gets better, the same amount of input will still lead to an increase in supply. This also shifts the supply curve to the right.
-The supply curve moves to the left if there is an increase in input cost.
-An equilibrium is a point where the plans of all market participants are realised simultaneously. At this point you are on the market demand curve and the market supply curve. The maximum willingness to pay and the maximum willingness to produce are the same.

Price Consumption Curve
-It is defined as the locus of combinations of Good 1 and Good 2 that the consumer will purchase corresponding to different values of relative price, money income remaining constant.
-If Good 1 is too expensive, the budget line will be just a point located on the Good 2 axis.
-As Good 1 becomes cheaper, the budget line shifts to the right eventually becoming parallel to the Good 1 axis when Good 1 becomes free.
