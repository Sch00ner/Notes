Theories of Crime -> will be discussed later

-Crimes are not universal. It depends on jurisdiction.

Why do crimes happen?
-Vengeance
-Poverty: Migrant workers returning to their native places with no support systems
-Crime has a direct relationship with economics
-Achieving an objective is key
-Sociological balance is upset. Balance between law and society is lost.
-Peer pressure. Can be held as abetment.
-Filing of counter cases. It hinders the judicial process.
-Faulty role models.

4.7.20

Sociological Theories of Crime
-Crime as a result of social phenomena or social change.
-Cultural phenomena or external forces are also part of this.
-The mentality of suicide bombers is molded by their socio-cultural milieu. These are at odds with those of society at large and thus, they are committing crimes.
-Socio-economic conditions of a person also affect a person and lead them to crime.
Structural theory
-If someone doesn't have the legitimate ways to achieve their objective, people will turn to illegitimate methods.
-Aspiration and attainment are the two points of structural theory. We must find out how to bridge them.

Sub-cultural theory
-When people adhere to cultural ideals that are inconsistent with the dominant mores of society.
-Crime in this case is the product of deviation from the overarching morals of society.
-In this case, people want to earn the respect of their peers and not society at large.

6.7.20

Biological theories of Crime
-Chromosomal abnormalities, hormone imbalances etc are the causes of crime.
-Maldeveloped brains are said to be a major factor in criminal activity.
-Early sociological influences in childhood can lead to this maldevelopment. Sexual violence or malnutrition as a child can strongly affect this.
-

-Sutherland says that criminal behaviour is a learned behaviour.

Psychological Theory of Crime
-Psychological trauma can manifest in criminal behaviour later.
-Psychological defects can lead to people failing to recognise appropriate social boundaries, which may lead them into criminality as they cannot distinguish between criminal and legal acts.
-Crime is the result of immature super-ego.

7.7.20

-Thus,cause of crime spans the social, biological and psychological spheres of life.
-If a sexual offence has been committed upon a child and this child goes back to school only to be victimised by the society. Society says it was the fault of the child for being the target of this crime, it leads to further revictimisation. Case in point, the Vishakha case.
-The role played by the parents is also important in future criminal behaviour. Attachment to a person with criminal tendencies, neglect or abuse lays the field for criminality.
-Early intervention programmes securing the health and development of children will be essential to preventing criminality. Even online classes where children may be excluded are against the interests of child rights.
-Supporting positive parenting techniques will also help in reduction of criminality. The kind of supervision a child receives  affects the development of a child. Research shows that risk-taking and delinquent behaviour have a correlative reduction with such techniques.

Economic Theories of Crime
-Assumes that people are rational actors who will respond predictably to economic stimuli.
-Increasing the expected cost of a crime, such as increasing the likelihood of getting caught will bring down crime rates.
-Having advocates engage in other trades with the blessing of the BCI is a legitimate way to suppress criminal behaviour.

Types of procedural law:
-What the legislature creates
-What the court creates
-A combination of both

-Lilavat Behera v State of Odisha: Her son was taken into custody and was later found dead with handcuffs on. Police said that he fled in the night and was hit by the train. The SC ruled against Odisha and compensation had to be paid to her. After this case and DK Basu v State of WB, the charges, place of detention and reason for arrest has to be outlined clearly.

9.7.20

Differences between substantive and procedural law

-Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav: Trial was conducted on video. So personal presence can be substituted with video conferencing.
-Sujay Mitra vs State of WB: Witness statement allowed through video conferencing.

10.7.20

Inquisitorial form of Judiciary
-Law of precedent is not strictly followed.
-The statute is supreme.
	1. Investigative Phase -  Public prosecutor collects evidence and decides whether to press forward with charges.
	2. Examination Phase - All the evidence is weighted by and a decision togo to trial or not is made by the judge.
	3. Trial Phase - 

State of Punjab v Gurmeet Singh: Justified the use of Sec. 327 of CrPC as thas that would help the victim in deposing without any intimidation, while sitting in open court.

Cognisable and Non-cognisable offences
-A complaint will be treated as an FIR in a cognisable offence. A complaint maybe elevated by the Magistrate into an FIR after talking with complainant and examining the situation.

14.7.20

What can a court do to get witnesses into court?
-In other common law jurisdiction, issue a subpoena writ. In India, issue summons and if they fail to turn up, threaten proceedings or start proceedings. Falls under contempt of court.

Investigation v Inquiry
-Investigtaion is usually done by a police officer. Inquiry is usually done by the magistrate or the court, they can never conduct an investigation.
-Investigation is the collection of the evidence. An inquiry verifies the facts, draws a conclusion and takes some action based upon this.
-Investigation is the first stage. Inquiry is the second stage of a case and usually preceded by the investigation.
-Inquiry is judicial in nature vs Enquiry is non-judicial and is done by police during the course of investigation. Investigation is also non-judicial. Enquiry is part of Investigation

What if police does not want to register a complaint?
-As an advocate, you would send the report of the incident to the SP and if he is satisfied, he would ask the police to register an FIR.
-Sec.166A of CrPC allows us to file a complaint if even the SP is not helping.
-You can go to the Magistrate in cognisable offences and he will direct the police to register an FIR.

16.7.20

-In an NCO there can never be an investigation.
We discussed an FIR. Just go look at a standard FIR, nothing else to see here.

17.7.20

-If the complaint is registered outside of the police station jurisdiction, it has to be recorded in the General Diary and then transferred to the appropriate police station.
-This is important in the context of sexual assault cases. It would be a violation to ask the victim to go back to the place of the assault and register the complaint there.
-Sec.157(1) emphasises this by saying that the statement of the victim in a sexual assault case should be recorded in their residence or in a place of their choice, by a woman police officer, as far as possible, in the company of parents, guardians, social worker etc.
-The judicial magistrate may take the help of a special expert when taking the statement of the victim.
-There is a dearth of training in procedural matters for the judicial machinery.
-FIR is neither concrete nor primary evidence. It is only corroborative evidence.
-Executive magistrates hear NCOs.
-When an oral complaint is the basis of registering an FIR and the complainant brings along a second written complaint about the same offence, the oral complaint will still be treated as the primary complaint. The second instance of information that the complainant brings along will be added to the FIR as additional information, being treated as a statement under Sec.161.

23.7.20

-During recording of statetement, it is advised to record the words of witnesses/complainany/accused as accurately as possible instead of in a boilerplate form.
-Boilerplate form is just bad practice, but won't make them inadmissible. However, to avoid discrepancies that could jeopardise the trial, this is discouraged.
-Under Sec.207, any statements so recorded should be made available to the other party because this is an adversarial system.
-Cross examination of witnesses is also an important part of the process in an adversarial system, like ours.
-Dinesh Dalmia case grapples with the problems of DDT and whether it infringes upon the right against self incrimination under Art.20(3). In this case, the judge decided that the DDT methods proposed by the CBI were not coercive in nature and could not be said to cause any harm to the accused. Thus, he allowed it to go forward.

Niloy Dutta v District Magistrate 1991 CRLJ 2933 Guwahati

-During trial, cross-examination is done to ensure that the evidence gathered under Sec.161 is credible.
-If the results of the cross-examination tally with those of the police investigation and report, it is held as good evidence.
-This also holds the police accountable and helps them to complete the investigation because lying is penalised.
-If there is a delay in recording witness statements, the delay must be explained by the police and it has to be corroborated by other evidence.
-Self incrimination is proetcted under Art.20 of the Constitution and Sec.161(2).
