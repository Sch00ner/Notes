-Pakistan SC had an inkling of the Basic Structure doctrine in the 1960s.No precedence as such. Restricting the powers of the Parliament to amend the constitution.
-A similar concept with no precedent is Fraud on the Constitution.
-Ordinances can be misused to propagate such a fraud on the Constitution. These ordinances are meant to be interim measures. The Parliament needs to be ratified within 6 weeks of it reconvening to be made a permanent law. But, ordinances can be continuously repromulgated to keep them in force. In Bihar, ordinances have been renewed like this for 32 years. The Constitution has no bar on such extended renewal. This is a way of circumventing Parliamentary scrutiny.
-Secretiveness is not desirable in all cases. For nuclear tests, yes. But, it can have a deleterious effect on the democratic system of governance if all acts were secret.
-Doctrine of enduring rights: Ordinance and its promulgation.

Constitutionalism = https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constitutionalism/
-A certain limit on the power of the sovereign.
-Problem with an all powerful sovereign.
-Indian equivalent in the concept of Rajdharma. Certain inherent duties in the position of the Raja circumscribe their powers. they have to live up to the concept of Rajdharma.
-Separation of powers in the Constitution is not as strict as traditional Western liberal democracies.

Amendment of the Constitution
-When the federal mechanisms are being affected, half the State Legislatures have to ratify the amendment under Art.368(2)
-Bihar Darbhanga case. Related to the Fundamental Right of Property. Argued by N.C. Chatterjee(father of Somnath Chatterjee) on behalf of the king of Darbhanga. He won the case and the court declared the particular land reform law unconstitutional.
-Art 31(A) & (B) brought in by amendment after the above case. Declared that estate laws would be beyond the scrutiny of courts. Brought in a Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, which said that whichever law was brought under this Schedule could not be scrutinised on the basis of Fundamental Rights.
-Shankari Prasad Singh Deo challenged this first constitutional amendment. Argued that the Parliament does not have an absolite power to amend the Constitution. No Fundamental Rights could be changed, according to him. Art.13 says that FRs cannot be derogated. Two questions were framed by the SC in relation to this case:
	1. Is an amendment a law?
	2.Can Fundamental Rights be amended?
-CJI Patanjali Shastri delivered the judgement. The SC said that amendments are not law. Law making is an act of legislative power, but constitutional amendments are made in the scope of the Constituent power of the Parliament. It is as if the Parliament steps into the shoes of the Constituent Assembly. Thus, FRs could be amended because amendments are outside the scope of "law", as under Art.13. This means that FRs could be amended ad infinitum with no restrictions upon the power of Parliament to change them.

State of WB v Bela Banerjee
State of WB v Subodh Gopal Bose
Dwarkadas Srinivas v Sholapur Spinning Company
-All these three cases were about land reform laws. The plea was to pay compensation at market rates for land confiscated under these laws.
-Compulsory acquisitioning of property: A nominal amount paid for the compulsory acquisition of any property. This amount is not negotiable or justiciable.
-Deprivation of property by operation of regulatory laws: No compensation to be paid for any property removed from one's ownership as a result of land reform laws.
-Hidayatullah and Mudholkar raised questions upon the power of the government to change the Constitution at their will, in the Sajjan Singh case.

9.7.20

-IC Golaknath case: Subbarao says that power to amend the Constitution is also a legislative power coming from Art.245 and 246. That there is nothing called constituent power. Thus, all powers of the Parliament is legislative.
-AG counters by saying that nothing in the Lists under 7th Schedule stating Constitutional amendments. Subbarao says that the power to make such amendments is a function of the residuary powers under the Union List, specifically Entry 97.
-Criticism of this judgement stems from the fact that Constitutional amendments are too important to be left upto just the residuary entry of the Union List.
-Doctrine of Prospective Over-ruling comes from this. In this case, Golaknath does not get this land back, but the Government would not be able acquire any more land under such land reform laws.

10.7.20

-Morarji Desai was opposed to bank nationalisation, a dream of Indira Gandhi.
-Nationalisation plan was drafted in secret by an under-secretary level officer.
-Neelam Sanjiva Reddy was the official candidate for Presidency, but Indira Gandhi propped up her own candidate, V.V. Giri. Giri won the Presidential election.
-IG was thrown out of the INC and formed Congress(R), as opposed to Congress(O). A majority of MPs walked out with her with only 30 or so MPs staying in the old Congress.
-Princely states' rulers were offered a privy purse, a certain sum of money every month from the public exchecquer. IG felt that this was not required and wanted to abolish the privy purse. IG had a majority in the Lok Sabha, but not in the Rajya Sabha. She has numerical majority in the Rajya Sabha, but only with the full strength of the supporters. Even one absentee would have seen her Bill scuttled. She pulled in all members, even sick people attached to saline IV lines, on a wheelchair.
-IG had exactly 250 members needed to pass the Bill in the RS. but, one of them disappeared. Thus, the Bill failed and the whole exercise was futile.
-A Presidential proclamation was passed the next day de-recognising all princely state rulers. Thus, the privy purse was abolished de-facto, since no one could receive the money.
-Nationalisation of banks is challenged in the case of RC Cooper v Union of India and princely state de-recognition was challenged in Madhav Rao Jivaji Scindia v UOI.
-RC Cooper struck down the bank nationalisation Act because it violated the Fundamental Rights with a ratio of 10:1 judges.
-De-recognition of princely states was also struck down with a majority of 9:2.
-AN Ray was part of the dissent in both cases. Later, he went on to become the CJI superseding 3 other justices.
-After her re-election in 1971, she brought about the 24th Constitutional amendment. amending Art.13 & 368. Explicitly stated now that Constitutional amendments are not laws and the power to amend the Constitution flows from 368.
-Art.31(C) was introduced too, in the subsequent 25th amendment. It deprived the power the of the courts to examine any law passed under this Article.
-Another amendment was passed in the same year, repealing the provision of privy purses under Art.292.
-In the 29th amendment, Kerala Land Reform and Kerala Land Reform Amendment Acts were included in the 9th Schedule. This led to a man called Kesavananda Bharati losing a lot of property.
-KB didn't really care about it, but he was persuaded by someparties to pursue this in the SC. Nani Palkhivala along with his junior Soli Sorabjee took up the case in the SC.

13.7.20

This was story time.

14.7.20

Kesavananda Bharati
-H.R. Khanna is the game changing judgement.
-The other 6 judges in opposition to the government say that the power of the Parliament to change the Constitution is not legislative but constituent in nature.
-Amendment does not mean that you can obliterate the basic features of the Constitution. In their opinion the FRs are part of these basic features.
-The limitation of amending powers is located by these 6 judges in the word amendment itself, in Art.368.
-Basic features according to these 6 judges:
	1.Sikri-Gives an exhaustive list. Supremacy of the constitution, republican and democratic form of government, secular characteristic of the constitution, separation of powers, federal character of the constitution, dignity of the individual. These were the only ones he considered basic features of the Constitution.
	2.Shelat and Grover- Gives an illustrative list. Sovereignty of India, unity and integrity of the nation,dignity of the individual as enshrined in Part 3 and welfare mandate as enshrined in Part 4. This is in addition to what Sikri said.
	3. Hegde and Mukherjee- Says their list is the same as Shelat and Grover's list. They added a specific element to this discourse.They wanted to figure out how a fundamental(they used this instead of basic) feature could be identified and settled on using the Preamble as a litmus test.
	4. Jaganmohan Reddy- Sovereign democratic republic, parliamentary democracy and the three organs of the state.

15.7.20

H.R. Khanna
-Khanna points out several logical fallacies in IC Golaknath
	1.Art. 245 which Subbarao says forms the power of making the amendments. There is a logical fallacy inherent in the Article itself. How can you change the provisions that you're also subject to, as outlined in Art.245.
	2.Subbarao says the power to make amendments flow from the Union List. But, for certain amendments even the states need to consent. So, how is it possible that this falls under the Union List?
	3.In multiple places in the Constitution you can find references to terms such as "Constitution and the law". This means that equating the Constitution with the law would be disastrous in the long run.
-Khanna does not specify what the Basic Structure is, in the judgement. Because he was wary that the government would use this knowledge to circumvent such protections.

16.7.20

H.R. Khanna(contd.)
-He ascertained that principles form part of the Basic Structure and not numbered constitutional provisions themselves.
-Logic being that FRs may need to be amended in the future and it would be a disservice to the nation to restrict their scope.
-There was a draft Art.304A which stated that FRs cannot be amended. This was rejected in the Constituent Assemsbly as amendments may be needed for future circumstances.
-Since the first Constitutional Amendment had been done in 1951 by members of the Constituent Assembly members acting as Parliament themselves, it would be illogical to say that FRs cannot be amended as Subbarao said.
-The Principle of Contemporaneous Exposition is that the true spirit of a law(or in this case, the Constitution) is to be found when it is interpreted according to the times it was constructed in and putting yourselves in the shoes of the makers. This extends to how the original makers themselves implemented and/or treated these provisions.
-By implication it means that the last part of 31C is strcuk down because it contravenes Basic Structure.
-Basic Structure is used only to evaluate constitutional amendments.
-25th and 29th constitutional amendments are valid.

17.7.20

-A.N. Ray was made CJI superceding Shelat, Grover and Hegde after the Kesavananda judgement. All of these judges resigned, along with the then Chief Justice Sikri.
-Sikri put in his resignation on the day of his retirement, as a protest against this injustice.
-In the election of 1971, there were allegations of electoral malpractices, against IG.
-RPA, 1951 outlines certain corrupt electoral practices.
	1.You can't use government officials to campaign for your election.
	2.You can't use government assets to campaign for your election.
	3.There is a ceiling for expenditure on the campaign.
-Raj Narayan was running against IG. He lost and filed an election petition in the Allahabad HC against her victory. Alleging that she used government assets, that she exceeded the expenditure ceiling, Yashpal Kapoor a senior IAS officer was used as an election agent for Rai Bareilly etc. He argued that because of these violations her victory should be annulled.
-On 12.6.1975, Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha declared her election invalid. Conspiracy theory: A copy of the judgement could not found till this year. Only a few pages were displayed from 1975 till this year, in the Allahabad HC museum.
-IG appealed the case in the SC. And it was referred to the vacation bench of the SC, led by Justice Krishna Iyer. It was just a single judge bench meant for interim relief and when the SC reopened from its summer vacation, the matter would be heard again.
On 24.6.1975, the appeal was heard. Justice Iyer granted the stay on a condition. The condition was that so long the case could be decided by the full SC, IG could not speak in Parliament.
-On 25th June of 1975, Emergency was declared. After this, IG passed the 39th Constitutional Amendment.
-It inserted Art.329A, which said that matters concerning the elections of Speaker, the President and the Prime Minister could only be decided by the Parliament.
-It also modified the laws concerning RPA and Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 1974, removing the practices IG was accused of and these were put into the 9th Schedule, thus rendering them toothless.

20.7.20

-The case has now moved into the Supreme Court proper, after its detour into the vacation bench.
-Art.329A was held invalid as it contravened the Basic Structure. It was struck down even by the loyalist judges.
-Khanna in this case left it at contravening the Basic Structure. But, the other judges started enumerating the reasons why it contravened the Basic Structure.
-They said that it has hit separation of powers, eqaulity, rule of law, free and fair elections, democracy.
-Since, this was a case against the PM, the losing candidate is deprived of his right to approach the court for electoral malpractice. He only has recourse to the Parliament and since the PM is the leader of the party with the largest majority, that is a foregone conclusion.
-The majority consisting of 4 judges said that BS is available only for constitutional amendments. Since, the laws amended are just ordinary laws, there cannot be a BS inquiry. Since it is under the 9th Schedule, a FR scrutiny also cannot be conducted. It does not violate any other constitutional provision either.
-Narayan contested that Parliament consisted of no Opposition members and media was also gagged, leading to an absence of public discourse. The SC said that it was not within their ambit to examine how Parliament conducted itself, only that there was a majority.
-Baig was the only judge who dissented and said that even ordinary laws are also susceptible to BS.

21.7.20

-The 42nd Amendment is passed during the Emergency. It was big enough to be a mini-Constitution by itself.
-Under this amendment, any law passed on grounds of securing the DPSP cannot be challenged at all. This means that the DPSP is placed above FRs.
-Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, 1974 was used to nationalise Minerva Mills, a textile mill. This would be the perfect aggrieved party for Palkhivala to challenge the 42nd Amendment. Since, this nationalisation Act was put in the 9th Schedule, this was a great chance.
-Without having 368(4 & 5) removed, a constitutional challenge on any provision was not sustainable. Thus, Palkhivala decided to challenge it on these grounds.
-In 1977, the Emergency was revoked and IG called elections on some bad advice from the IB. IG lost her seat of Raebareli and the Janata Party government came into power.
-The Janata Party got rid of everything in the 42nd Amendment except Art.368(4 & 5), Secularism and Socialism in the Preamble and the amended Art.31(C).
-Palkhivala's argument was that Art.368 prevented the SC from exercising any jurisdiction over constitutional amendments. This means that the power to amend was unrestricted, this was a limitation on the BS. This limitation on the BS itself was a violation of the BS, so it must be struck down. This is a self-reinforcing argument, that the BS exists is a merit of the BS itself.
-The nationalisation has happened before the amendment of Art.31(C). So, how is Palkhivala challenging the amended Art.31(C)? But somehow, the SC acquiesced to his request to argue on this point.

22.7.20

-Whenever a constitutional amendment is declared unconstitutional or any law, then that law is eclipsed but still there. It cannot be used but it is removed only when expressly repealed by the Parliament. Till then, it is there and if later on it is declared constitutional, the law or amendment can be used again. 
-Minerva Mills- merits part. Palkivala knew that the act he was challenging was passed on the basis of unamended 31 C not the amended one. As said above, he was asked to carry on. He said that he was okay with unamended 31 C which balanced FR and DPSPs. The moment prioritising DPSPs above all FRs, that’s an issue. FRs being made subservient. Specially 14 and 19 which 31 C had mentioned specially. But then 31 was removed from the list of 14, 19 and 31. 
Chandrachud said that the harmony and balance between DPSPs and FRs is a part of the basic structure. Therefore, the amendment to 31 C was struck down. The expansion was struck down. Not the original 31 C. 
-Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Lt v Bharat Coking Coal Ltd (5 judge)- In this case the entire discussion on 31 C was seen as obiter Dicta in Minerva Mills, since it had no relation to the facts at hand. Therefore, not binding on future courts. 
-Apart from this case, the discussion was accepted as ratio by acquiescence. Like KB case. No one else raised a question. 
-Vaman Rao case- Whether laws put into the ninth schedule are completely immune?
-Vaman Rao looks at the validity of all consti amendments upto Kesavananda Bharti. Assuming that the basic structure was present from the starting of the constitution. Tested all amendments. None of the amendment violated the BS. According to them. Including the first amendment. Creating ninth schedule does not violate Basic structure. 
-But they said, post 24th April, 1973 (KB), every time 9th Schedule is amended to put a law into it, even that is subject to the BS test. Because an amendment is needed to put an ordinary law into the ninth schedule. But that amendment is nothing without the law itself. Anyway, we cannot say that the amendment can be tested but the law cannot be. That will not be logical, there wont be any test if law cannot be tested. Therefore, Vaman Rao says, post 24th April, if anyone is amending the constitution to put an ordinary law into the ninth schedule, that ordinary law will be put to a basic structure test. Not all laws, only ones put into the  ninth schedule.
-Bhagwati felt that prioritising DPSP over all FRs was not disharmonious. He was the only dissenting judge.

23.7.20

-From 80s to about 2006-7, there is very little jurisprudential development so far as the BS is concerned. 
-One step back and going back to Indira Gandhi. Some things yet to be discussed on the cases we have done already. 
-In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, one question there in everyone’s mind. Fundamental Rights don’t form part of the basic structure? What does it actually mean? Asked of Justice Khanna is this case. Are no FR part of the BS? Khanna said that he never said no FR are part of the BS. All he said that, as a block all FR cannot form a part of the BS. In fact, in this case, equality was considered to be part of the Basic Structure. 
-Article 31 (Right to Property) was hence repealed from the constitution. It became easy for him, because of Khanna’s position. 
-In this case, Justice Mathew went so far as to say that if a ninth schedule law is in violation of any such FR which forms a part of the BS, we can scrutinise it. This, in a way, goes against the larger finding of the bench which said that no ordinary law can be put to a BS test. Vaman Rao extended it. 
-Why did Justice Mathew not do a scrutiny then? As equality was held to be a part of the BS. Because equality formed a part of the BS only according to Chandrachud, not Mathew. Or else maybe he would have. 
-In Minerva Mills, Justice Chandrachud also said that the relationship between 14, 19 and 21 is a golden triangle and form a part of the basic structure. Not individual rights but only the relationship. This was made by the Maneka Gandhi case, and reiterated in the Minerva Mills case. 
-So laws put into the ninth schedule cannot be subjected to FR scrutiny but BS scrutiny. What if laws are against FR principles which forms a part of the BS? Answered by Mathew and also Chandrachud in Minerva Mills. Read their points above. 
-IR Coelho case. By the time it was being heard in 2007, 9th Schedule had 284 laws. 
-In 2007, case called M Nagaraj v. Union of India. In this case, 77th , 81st, 82nd and 85th were challenged. They had made certain changes to Article 16 because of reservation provisions. No need to understand the holding, too technical and we have to understand reservation provisions. The important part- for the first time the court is trying to evolve a BS test, how to know if a law is against the Basic Structure. It’s a 2-prong test
-Width test and Identity test. 
-First stretch the amendment to its maximum extent. Extend the meaning to as many situations as the amendment might come into play. After giving widest possible scope, look at whether any restriction has been violated. If yes, strike down. 
-2nd- Look at whether the amendment is altering the core identity of the constitution. If yes, strike down. 
-Both have to be satisfied. 
-Both are known as essence of rights test. Therefore, the court is looking at principles not the rights and provisions themselves. Gives the example of 14, 19, 21, saying that any law must be reasonable if it hits these articles. So reasonability is the restriction here. It is the essence. Essence can be proportionality or any other principle. They didn’t go beyond rights here. Since the case dealt with Article 16. 
-The difference finally comes to light in the IR Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu case. Iske pehle, mostly same principles. It was a long pending case, regarding laws in late 60s. 
-The law was held to be in violation of FR but despite that the law was put into the ninth Schedule. Can this be done? The law was void ab initio. 
-The question remained unanswered till 2007. A seven-judge bench in Coelho, Justice Sabharwal was the CJI. Also reconsidered Vaman Rao.
-They discussed the essence of rights test. What if the entire fundamental rights chapter is undone? The essence of rights test will be of no use. Merely focussing on essence of rights test wont be enough. 
-The court gave something call the rights test not essence of the rights. Again go back to Mathew and Chandrachud above and then Vaman Rao and Nagaraj. From all of those, the court said there can be FRs which can be part of the Basic Structure. Which ones? 14, 19, 21. He puts numbered articles as part of the BS. He also talks about 15 and 16 along with 14 and Article 32 being part of the BS. It’s a unanimous judgement. Therefore, any law put into the ninth schedule is open to an Article 32 scrutiny. What is it? A fundamental rights scrutiny. So no matter what the ninth schedule says, the moment Article 32 into the BS, all ninth schedule laws subjected to all FRs. 
-Sir, why did they say that the essence of rights test will be redundant if the entire chapter on FR is undone? Because it talks about individual rights. But laws put into the ninth schedule are fully immune from a FR scrutiny. 
-The judgement was prospective in nature.
-Justice Mathew went so far as to say that if a 9th Schedule law is in conflict with any FR which is a part of BS. then it could be scrutinised on the basis of that FR. He said this in the IG case.
-This deviates from Vaman Rao which said that you could do a complete BS scrutiny. Mathew was much more restrictive in his opinion.

24.7.20

-Post Kesavananda, constitutional amendment, ordinary law put into 9th Schedule is subject to BS. After Coelho, ordinary law under 9th Schedule is subject to entire FRs. Ordinary laws are not part of BS according to IG and Kesavananda, but, some other cases have said they are.

-Kuldeep Nayar said you can't make ordinary laws part of BS. But, other cases have said you can. Madras Bar association case is one such.
-In S.R. Bommai, 4 BJP governments were dismissed in favour of President's Rule. The SC upheld the dismissal because secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution.
-There was a corrupt judge in Gujarat with an FIR against him in 1991. The SC took cognisance, quashed the FIR and said to drop all charges and investigations stopped.. The SC said Art.141 & 142 are part of the BS in this case.
In G.C. Kanungo v State of Orissa, even the Arbitration Act was scrutinised on the basis of BS.

27.7.20

-If Coelho is read in isolation, it leads to the conclusion that the 9th Schedule has been neutered like a puppy.

Glanrock Plantations Pvt Ltd v State of Tamil Nadu
-Every violation of Art.14 will not be considered in light of BS and FR.
-If the violation is to such an extent that the underlying principles of Art.14 are endangered only then will it be adjudicated upon BS and FR.

KT Plantations v State of Kerala

Indian Medical Association v Union of India
-Essence of rights test to be used if the scope of any right is sought to be restricted.

STARTING JUDICIARY

28.7.20

Union of India v Sankalchand Himmatlal Sheth
-Challenged his transfer from Gujarat HC to AP HC.
-Government argued that they had had a consultation, but refused to divulge what it entailed.
-SC said that the consultation has to be a "real, substantial and effective" one and it has to be based on substantial material upon which the decision is made.
-SC also said that the transfer process is open to judicial review, through the mouth of Chandrachud.

S.P. Gupta v Union of India (First Judges Case)
-SC says that there is executive primacy in judicial appointments, mellowing its stance.
-The consultation still has to be meaningful and based on substantial material.
-But, the President may completely ignore the recommendations of the Chief Justice and it will not be subject to judicial review.

Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association v Union of India 1993 (Second Judges Case)
-President cannot appoint a judge unless the Chief Justice concurs with him.
-Primacy has shifted to the judiciary now. (ping pong is a great game)
-Chief Justice's opinion is the opinion of the collegium and not his alone. The collegium used to be a convention, but through this judgement it gains constitutional validity.
-Lots of questions raised by the judgement: what is the inner process of the collegium, how it will be constituted, negative aspersions cast on judges whose seniority was ignored etc.

29.7.20
In re Presidential Reference (Third Judges Case)
-

3.8.20

Jurisdiction of Courts
-Original Jurisdiction(OJ) is where to the exclusion of all other courts, you can go straight to the SC with your case.
-This OJ is outlined in Art.131. But, it is not clear what legal rights are supposed to mean in this context.
-In 2019, Chattisgarh challenged the NIA has to be declared unconstitutional because it takes away power from State list as police and public order are State matters. Kerala also filed a suit against the Union under 131 for declaring CAA constitutional because it violates Arts.14, 19 & 21.
-Kerala argued that if the State Government refuses to implement any order by the Central Government under Art.256, it can be a ground for declaring President's Rule under Art.365. This puts Kerala in a spot where the State's legal rights can be curtailed because they refuse to implement an unconstitutional executive order.
-Govt of WB filed a suit under 131 too because the Union Govt. declared that coal bearing land can be acquired by the Centre, so what happens to the righs of the State?
-Rajasthan too filed a suit against the Union Govt in 1977 after the General Election results were announced. Charan Singh of the Janata Party wrote a letter to Congress CMs telling them that there had been a revolution against the Congress and they should also step down. Otherwise, Charan Singh threatened to have President's Rule imposed in those nine states.
-A CM of Karnataka had corruption allegations against him. So, the Union Govt. set up a committee to inquire into these allegations and advised the CM to step down while the investigation was ongoing, returning when he was cleared. Karnataka filed a suit under Art.131 and the Union Govt. said that this does not impugn any rights of the State and only the rights of an individual was the matter here, that being the CM. SC said that the State is inseparable from the State Govt. and it is inseparable from the person who runs it, i.e., the CM, thus the case was not dismissed on grounds of jurisdiction.

4.8.20

Appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
-Under Art.132(1), only after all HC appeals have been exhausted will an appeal lie to the SC.
-Under 132, SC appeal could be for any kind of proceeding civil,criminal or otherwise. But,the HC has to certify the appeal on grounds of substantial question of law regarding the Constitution.
-Certification can be granted when a HC is uncomfortable with the current SC precedent or if there are conflicting HC judgements.
-Under Art.133, SC appeal will only be for civil matters. But the HC will have to certify that it involves a substantial question of law of general importance. But, this certificate cannot be given by a single judge bench of a HC.
-SC has directed that single judges of a HC not grant a certificate for appeal to the SC without applying to a division bench of the HC first.
-Under Art.134, you don't need a certificate to appeal to the SC in two cases. One, where the HC has reversed an acquital by a lower court and has handed out a death sentence. Two, where the HC has taken up a case still being heard by the lower court and then handed out a death sentence. The third provision is the usual manner of the HC granting a certificate to appeal to the SC.

5.8.20

-Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970. Look it up.
-Election Commission v. Saka Venkata Subba Rao 1953, a single judge gave the certificate for appeal to the SC. RD Agarwala v UOI 1970, a single judge was barred from giving a certificate of appeal to the SC.
-Art.136 is a very open ended way left open for the SC to hear a case.
-Pritam Sing v State 1950: Generally speaking, this Court will not grant special leave, unless it is shown that exceptional and special circumstances exist, that substantial and grave injustice has been done and that the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against.
-Mathai alias Joby v. George & Another 2010: Criteria for SLPs sought. Referred it to a constitutional bench. Took note of a Venugopal lecture which said that SLPs should be considered only in a narrow set of cases:
	1. “All matters involving substantial questions of law relating to the interpretation of the Constitution of India.

	2. Substantial questions of law of general importance.

	3. All matters of national or public importance.

	4. Validity of laws, Central and State.

	5. After Kesavananda Bharati, the judicial review of Constitutional Amendments.

	6. To settle differences of opinion of important issues of law between High Courts.
-This constitution bench after 6 years, delivered its opinion: Upon perusal of the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid judgments, in our opinion, no effort should be made to restrict the powers of this Court under Article 136 because while exercising its powers under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, this Court can, after considering facts of the case to be decided, very well use its discretion. In the interest of justice, in our view, it would be better to use the said power with circumspection, rather than to limit the power forever.

6.8.20

-Other things SC can also do. After the SC delivers its judgement. Lets say it was a criminal appeal and the SC held someone guilty. Couple of weeks later, it is found that there is a new fact. This new fact will turn the outcome of the case completely. In such cases, the SC is empowered to review its original judgement. 
-Lets say there was an error apparent on the face of it. Like there was a precedent which would have influenced the case, or a statutory law- to which reference has not been made. These judgements are per incuriam. Here also, SC can review the case. 
-Third, any other reason. Article 137 (Subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament or any rules made under article 145, the Supreme Court shall have power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it) talks about review. Order 47, Rule 1 of the CPC. 
-Review petitions are filed and on the basis of review petitions SC decides whether or not to accept. 
-Usually review petitions must be filed within 30 days of judgement. Order 40, Rule 2. Not compulsory of course. New fact may come to light later on. As far as possible, review has to be heard by the same bench. Except in certain circumstances- like if a judge has retired. Or error apparent is that one of the judges has a personal bias in the outcome. Judge must have recused but didn’t. 
-Reviews are not heard in open courts. The petition is circulated around the chambers. The judges in circulation decide whether to entertain or not. Then they can allow an open court hearing. 
-Review is not an appeal- not supposed to take new arguments. Limited playing field with the SC. It is the last stage of the SC.
-2002 case- Rupa Ashoke Hurra v. Ashoke Hurra- SC invoked its powers to do complete justice under 142, SC said that even after a case has been dismissed on review, a case can still be reopened using a curative petition. The constitution does not mention curative petition, SC’s creation. 
-In a curative petition, a senior lawyer has to sign that a petition is fit for curative petition. Also, it must be heard by the same bench. But which same bench? The one which decided original or the review? This caused some confusion when Afzal Guru’s curative petition was filed. As of now, original bench.
-If curative petition filed on extremely frivolous grounds even after the lawyer’s signature, it will be dismissed with exemplary costs.

Advisory Jurisdiction of Supreme Court(Art.143)
-The Council of Ministers through the President can refer matters to the SC.
-The cause of action may have come about or thought to come around.
-The SC has the discretion to reply or not.
-The SC was asked whether or not there was a temple or mosque in Ayodhya in the past.
-In re the Delhi Law Act, AIR 1951 SC 332 was the first time SC was asked for advice.
-In re Kerala Education Bill, AIR 1958 SC 956 was the second time the SC was asked for advice. The SC, in this case, said that they were not bound to mandatorily reply when asked for advice.
-Minimum number of judges for this is five.
-This advice is not the law of the land and binding, technically speaking.
-However, there was the case of In re Special Courts Bill, AIR 1979 SC 478. This bill was brought forward by Ram Jethmalani to set up courts to prosecute Emergency related violations. In this case, Chandrachud said, “It would be strange that a decision given by this Court on a question of law in a dispute between two private parties should be binding on all courts in this country but the advisory opinion should bind no one at all, even if, as in the instant case, it is given after issuing notice to all interested parties, after hearing everyone concerned.”
