## What is Intersectionality?
- Intersectionality is the compounding of factors that work to a person's disadvantage.
- Definitions can often become restrictive and foreclose options before considering all the factors.
- A person does not need to think of themselves as a feminist for ther to be a feminist perspective of it.

## Harriet Tubman & Combahee River Collective
Harriet Tubman was promised her freedom by her owner, but was later denied. She ran away from her master and later used her experience as a fugitive slave to help others escape, by what is called the Underground Railroad. She was also famous for leading the raid on the Combahee Ferry which freed almost 700-800 slaves.

A century later, a collective called the Combahee River Collective issued a statement which declared that the fate of Black women had never been examined consistently before and that they would be the ones to do so because they are writing from a place of love for themselves. They emphasised that the racial and sexual discrimination they faced could not be feasibly separated and were experienced simultaneously. This could only be mitigated by ending the systems of patriarchy, capitalism, imperialism etc. They also quote Michelle Wallace and say that they have to fight the world because if Black women were free, it would mean that everyone was free as they were lowest in the hierarchy.

## Kimberle Crenshaw
- Kimberle Crenshaw is a black feminist lawyer who started the discourse on intersectionality as we know it today.
- She [[Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex A Black Feminist Critique.pdf|talks about]] how there is a multidimensional aspect to the experiences of discrimination faced by a Black woman.
- For example, in the DeGraffenreid case, where the judge says Black women cannot ask for "super-remedy" based on both their Blackness and their sex.

**Q:** If we are to consider intersectionality as a multidimensional matrix, what are the basis vectors of the plane because if we don't know what they are, will Black people not continue to slip through the gaps?
**A:** We almost have to put aside the person's own perspective in order to identify them and "protect" them, but in doing so robs them of their identity. This shows us that there is always a gap between the language of the law and its impact in the real world. We need to grapple with the grey areas instead of seeking an absolute solution which can be a problem in itself.

**Q:** How is anti-essentialism different from intersectionality? 
**A:** At that particlular moment in history anti-essentialism is tied deeply to anti-foundationalism which means that you have no solid ground to build upon. The Cold War had shown that neither Western democracy nor Soviet communism could live up to the aspirations of the people, with recently decolonised states also sliding into autocracy. This led to disillusionment with grand ideals of freedom, self-governance etc.
Anti-essentialism was a response to this, with norms and characteristics that were far more unstable and nebulous than previously thought because systems of good could be used to propagate bad, like recently free decolonised states becoming dictatorial under the rule of their own people.
This emergence of anti-essentialism meant that we either did away with the normative Western framework where freedom and other such qualities were by default good or we accept that there is a lot more heterogeneity to be explored.
Intersectionality emerged out of a conversation about identity, where some things were being overlooked like intra group oppression. This would engender a positive duty or rather, compulsion to politically organise to counter this. This is different from anti-essentialism which was deeply sceptical of any large scale political organisation based on their disillusionment with the grand ideals of the time.

### Seeing as evidence
The prioritisation of seeing as the basis of an evidentiary framework, contained in the term "prima facie", could be seen as a result of the Enlightenment era in Europe with the rise of the scientific principle. This is reflected in the case of Rodney King, where the video of his beating is turned against him.

#### Rodney King
- The video of Rodney King was isolated into a few frames and these images were then used to exonerate the policemen, void of their context.
- There is also a sexual undertone to the beating of black men like Rodney. Where white paranoia manifests in homophobia represented by phallic instruments of applying violence, like batons.

The Rigoberta Menchu and Anita Hill cases raise questions about judgement and testimony. It is similar to the recent Tarun Tejpal case of sexual assault.

This [[Why We Doubt What Women Say About Their Lives.pdf|book]] talks about tainted witnesses whose testimony cannot be relied upon.
This has been replicated across history such as the Criminal Tribes scheme in British India.

# 9.6.21

The law itself is not evaluating experiences, it is actively creating experiences of trauma.

## Rigoberta Menchu
- A Guatemalan activist who campaigned for indigenous rights and pursued the conviction of human rights violations and the Spanish Embassy burning where people died.
- David Stoll had written a book called *Rigoberta MenchÃº and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans* that contradicted some of the points in her story.

## Anita Hill
- She wrote about the sexual harrassment she had suffered at the hands of Clarence Thomas.
- She had to testify in front of a committee which degraded her status as a victim and painted her as the party at fault.
- Full of white men and headed by centrist in chief, Joe Biden.
- Clarence Thomas was also in danger of becoming a tainted witness himself once he lost the advantage of his race because Anita was also black. She had gender on her side and he had race.
- Clarence later weaponised white guilt and said that Anita was a front used by white racists who didn't want a black judge to succeed. He not only racialised himself, but he had to deracialise Anita to succeed.

## Hadiya
- We all know the [[https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hadiya-case-a-timeline-of-kerala-love-jihad-case-1780500|story]].
- A display of the person being an insufficient witness of the experiences of their own life.

From this, we can gather that there can be no perfect victim. No victim that can have a legitimate claim to their suffering or being wronged. The system will find ways to discredit anyone on the stand, as and when it wants.

## Ambedkar
Realised that constitutional law didn't really talk about Ambedkar's identity as a factor in the making of the Constitution.

## Implications of Rights based approach
- A top down change is most likely.
- Legal crusaders may not pay attention to democratic processes of negotiation in the community, opting instead for a legal victory.
- This approach does have more immediate and tangible effects, but it may also lead to outcomes that may not align with the community's interests.
- Courts are the guardian of our rights, but they also are in charge of imprisonment. This can introduce some friction into the process itself.
- Prisons don't take into account the gender of trans people and stuff them wherever they want.
- We may confuse choice for freedom. People, such as young adults may still operate under some coercion as to how they conduct themselves in their parents' house.
- A lot of disability is generated from passively malignant factors like young mothers being anaemic or contracting polio.
- The PoA Act has a very low conviction rate and it's not even taught in class. This makes the lives of disabled lower caste people much harder than it is meant to be.

An intersectional approach, on the other hand, would say that the normative foundation of law itself to be challenged. Not making disabled/disadvantaged people become more able to do things and/or participate in the status quo.

There can be no community where everything is great. Living with others is inherently inconvenient. However, making sure that this hurt and anger is channelled in a constructive way is important.

>**Read:** *Structures of Feelings* by Raymond Williams.

**Q:** How do you shift the conversation from the dominant of a community to those who are traditionally under-represented?
**A:** Maybe reservations, but also shifting the focus of the conversation from just the dominant table itself.

- What happens when the state itself makes new disabled persons? Like in Gaza or police violence or polluting water sources by mining corporations.
- Global North profits from debilitating the Global South. Extracting skilled manpower and activating sanctions against poorer nations etc.
- These are long colonial flows, such as even a country like Italy, which is not particularly rich, but still benefits from Ethiopian workers.

## Section 377
- Criminalised sexual acts against the "*order of nature*".
- Had a chilling effect on the queer community even though it didn't criminalise homosexuality.
- Instituted by the British by way of the Indian Penal Code.
- While it didn't have much life in the courts, it could lead to blackmail, sexual exploitation and a general environment of fear.
- Queer activists argued exactly this, that while it was not used as a legal cudgel, it would and has lead to intimidation by its very virtue.
- Nas argued that because of Section 377, the queer movement was going underground. The argument also emphasised that this makes it hard to prevent HIV.
- Protests were organised in 1991 by ABBA in support of HIV patients, then the movie *Fire* in 1998 which was accused of being against Hindu culture, then a spate of lesbian suicides before the World Social Forum.
- AP Shah and Muralidhar read Section 377 and said in the context of India, even going against the caste order would be considered "*unnatural*". Ambedkar had demolished this notion and the judges took this to mean that intercaste marriage and queerness could exist and was not "*unnatural*".
- In Suresh Koushal, the SC reasoned that it only applied to certain kinds of non-consensual acts and not any identity.
- It was said that the judges could only deliver the Koushal judgement because there were no queer people in the courtroom to deny the separation between acts and identity.

### Caste and Section 377
- The testimony that was provided during 2009 was different. It was about being thrown out of houses, social abandonment. This was different from the 2012 judgement which talked about the inconvenience of not having marriage recognised.
- This meant that queerness was restricted to an upper caste identity because the kind of petitioners who applied were not cognisant of problems faced by queer people with reduced caste privilege, such as Ritu Dalmia and Navtej Johar.
- Like in Dhrubo Jyoti's [[Dhrubo Jyoti - A Letter to My Lover.pdf|piece]], we can see that queerness is not a glue that can bridge the caste differential and queer people associate mostly with those of their own social standings.

**Social Morality:** Depends on the prevailing social tendencies or milieu.
**Constitutional Morality:** Depends on constitutional interpretation and may go against social morality.
For example, when khap panchayats in Haryana had said the consumption of chowmein was leading to more rapes. This runs contrary to the perspective of consitutional morality, but aligns well with social morality.

### Puttaswamy and Privacy
**Q:** What does the right to privacy in Puttaswamy cover? When would you apply to it?
**A:** Mainly talks about data protection. Issues regarding technology, regulations over activities between the 4 walls which is victimless.

- 3 prong test to determine the threshold of privacy.
- Laid down the contours of privacy in India.
- Privacy is not restricted spatially, it protects people not spaces.
- Even then, queerness cannot be restricted to just the 4 walls of the bedroom. Queer people deserve privacy outside of the 4 walls too.


### Gay marriage
- There is a problem with the level of heteronormativity in the advocacy for gay marriage.
- Gay marriage has become a flagpost that is alluring, but ultimately an insufficient expression of progressing queer rights.
- What is the point of forcing another oppressive institution on queer people? Abolishing marriage would be a better outcome than extending it to more people.
- What is also the point of gating certain benefits behind marriage? Like, tax breaks or inheritance etc.
- The reason the conversation of queer freedom moves from decriminalisation to marriage is because upper class, upper caste queer people represent the movement. 
- The vast majority of queer people are alienated from property relations in the country and also alienated from a familial structure that can afford them any inheritance.
- Constitutional morality would ideally object to gating these rights behind marriage, when the government cannot guarantee that I do find a partner for such.

## Dhrubo Jyoti
- The story of the differing experiences of queer people, in essence.
- The recognition of sexuality is filtered through caste. It cannot be divorced from the author's caste position.
- Dhrubo had to labour to be included in the queer community, a community that is supposed to be his.
- Dhrubo says that shame is not something cannot easily be overcome. It is a far more recalcitrant version of sexuality that cannot be reconciled easily.
- Constitutinal morality may be something that one reaches out to when one goes to the court. But, social morality is where one spends the most time and cannot be ignored.
- This piece shows that some people cannot be held in the word sexuality as said in the judgement striking down Section 377.
- Intersectionality is not something that can be added to a problem to make it better. Often, there are extremely difficult decisions to be made regarding who to represent in a legal case.

**Q:** How to locate universality in a quest for rights?
**A:** It may not always be possible for people to agree without some kind of specificity in sight. This specificity will depend on the social context of those who are trying to a universal narrative.
