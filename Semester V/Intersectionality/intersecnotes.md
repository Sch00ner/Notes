## What is Intersectionality?
- Intersectionality is the compounding of factors that work to a person's disadvantage.
- Definitions can often become restrictive and foreclose options before considering all the factors.
- A person does not need to think of themselves as a feminist for ther to be a feminist perspective of it.

## Harriet Tubman & Combahee River Collective
Harriet Tubman was promised her freedom by her owner, but was later denied. She ran away from her master and later used her experience as a fugitive slave to help others escape, by what is called the Underground Railroad. She was also famous for leading the raid on the Combahee Ferry which freed almost 700-800 slaves.

A century later, a collective called the Combahee River Collective issued a statement which declared that the fate of Black women had never been examined consistently before and that they would be the ones to do so because they are writing from a place of love for themselves. They emphasised that the racial and sexual discrimination they faced could not be feasibly separated and were experienced simultaneously. This could only be mitigated by ending the systems of patriarchy, capitalism, imperialism etc. They also quote Michelle Wallace and say that they have to fight the world because if Black women were free, it would mean that everyone was free as they were lowest in the hierarchy.

## Kimberle Crenshaw
- Kimberle Crenshaw is a black feminist lawyer who started the discourse on intersectionality as we know it today.
- She [talks about](Demarginalizing%20the%20Intersection%20of%20Race%20and%20Sex%20A%20Black%20Feminist%20Critique.pdf) how there is a multidimensional aspect to the experiences of discrimination faced by a Black woman.
- For example, in the DeGraffenreid case, where the judge says Black women cannot ask for "super-remedy" based on both their Blackness and their sex.

**Q:** If we are to consider intersectionality as a multidimensional matrix, what are the basis vectors of the plane because if we don't know what they are, will Black people not continue to slip through the gaps?
**A:** We almost have to put aside the person's own perspective in order to identify them and "protect" them, but in doing so robs them of their identity. This shows us that there is always a gap between the language of the law and its impact in the real world. We need to grapple with the grey areas instead of seeking an absolute solution which can be a problem in itself.

**Q:** How is anti-essentialism different from intersectionality? 
**A:** At that particlular moment in history anti-essentialism is tied deeply to anti-foundationalism which means that you have no solid ground to build upon. The Cold War had shown that neither Western democracy nor Soviet communism could live up to the aspirations of the people, with recently decolonised states also sliding into autocracy. This led to disillusionment with grand ideals of freedom, self-governance etc.
Anti-essentialism was a response to this, with norms and characteristics that were far more unstable and nebulous than previously thought because systems of good could be used to propagate bad, like recently free decolonised states becoming dictatorial under the rule of their own people.
This emergence of anti-essentialism meant that we either did away with the normative Western framework where freedom and other such qualities were by default good or we accept that there is a lot more heterogeneity to be explored.
Intersectionality emerged out of a conversation about identity, where some things were being overlooked like intra group oppression. This would engender a positive duty or rather, compulsion to politically organise to counter this. This is different from anti-essentialism which was deeply sceptical of any large scale political organisation based on their disillusionment with the grand ideals of the time.

### Seeing as evidence
The prioritisation of seeing as the basis of an evidentiary framework, contained in the term "prima facie", could be seen as a result of the Enlightenment era in Europe with the rise of the scientific principle. This is reflected in the case of Rodney King, where the video of his beating is turned against him.

#### Rodney King
- The video of Rodney King was isolated into a few frames and these images were then used to exonerate the policemen, void of their context.
- There is also a sexual undertone to the beating of black men like Rodney. Where white paranoia manifests in homophobia represented by phallic instruments of applying violence, like batons.

The Rigoberta Menchu and Anita Hill cases raise questions about judgement and testimony. It is similar to the recent Tarun Tejpal case of sexual assault.

The [book](Why%20We%20Doubt%20What%20Women%20Say%20About%20Their%20Lives.pdf) talks about tainted witnesses whose testimony cannot be relied upon.
This has been replicated across history such as the Criminal Tribes scheme in British India.

The law itself is not evaluating experiences, it is actively creating experiences of trauma.

## Rigoberta Menchu
- A Guatemalan activist who campaigned for indigenous rights and pursued the conviction of human rights violations and the Spanish Embassy burning where people died.
- David Stoll had written a book called *Rigoberta Mench√∫ and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans* that contradicted some of the points in her story.

## Anita Hill
- She wrote about the sexual harrassment she had suffered at the hands of Clarence Thomas.
- She had to testify in front of a committee which degraded her status as a victim and painted her as the party at fault.
- Full of white men and headed by centrist in chief, Joe Biden.
- Clarence Thomas was also in danger of becoming a tainted witness himself once he lost the advantage of his race because Anita was also black. She had gender on her side and he had race.
- Clarence later weaponised white guilt and said that Anita was a front used by white racists who didn't want a black judge to succeed. He not only racialised himself, but he had to deracialise Anita to succeed.

## Hadiya
- We all know the [story](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hadiya-case-a-timeline-of-kerala-love-jihad-case-1780500).
- A display of the person being an insufficient witness of the experiences of their own life.

From this, we can gather that there can be no perfect victim. No victim that can have a legitimate claim to their suffering or being wronged. The system will find ways to discredit anyone on the stand, as and when it wants.

## Ambedkar
Realised that constitutional law didn't really talk about Ambedkar's identity as a factor in the making of the Constitution.

## Implications of Rights based approach
- A top down change is most likely.
- Legal crusaders may not pay attention to democratic processes of negotiation in the community, opting instead for a legal victory.
- This approach does have more immediate and tangible effects, but it may also lead to outcomes that may not align with the community's interests.
- Courts are the guardian of our rights, but they also are in charge of imprisonment. This can introduce some friction into the process itself.
- Prisons don't take into account the gender of trans people and stuff them wherever they want.
- We may confuse choice for freedom. People, such as young adults may still operate under some coercion as to how they conduct themselves in their parents' house.
- A lot of disability is generated from passively malignant factors like young mothers being anaemic or contracting polio.
- The PoA Act has a very low conviction rate and it's not even taught in class. This makes the lives of disabled lower caste people much harder than it is meant to be.

An intersectional approach, on the other hand, would say that the normative foundation of law itself to be challenged. Not making disabled/disadvantaged people become more able to do things and/or participate in the status quo.

There can be no community where everything is great. Living with others is inherently inconvenient. However, making sure that this hurt and anger is channelled in a constructive way is important.

**Read:** *Structures of Feelings* by Raymond Williams.

**Q:** How do you shift the conversation from the dominant of a community to those who are traditionally under-represented?
**A:** Maybe reservations, but also shifting the focus of the conversation from just the dominant table itself.

- What happens when the state itself makes new disabled persons? Like in Gaza or police violence or polluting water sources by mining corporations.
- Global North profits from debilitating the Global South. Extracting skilled manpower and activating sanctions against poorer nations etc.
- These are long colonial flows, such as even a country like Italy, which is not particularly rich, but still benefits from Ethiopian workers.
