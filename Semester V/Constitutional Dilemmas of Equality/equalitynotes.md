**Structure of the class:** A case will be the main topic of discussion. Then, it will branch out to issues related to the case.

## Questions for the course

### What kind of discrimination is impactful?
Like in Tarunabh Khaitan's piece, what features should be protected against discrimination?

### Whom should we tell not to discriminate?
Balancing act between individual autonomy and anti-discrimination policies. Whom can we ask not to discriminate?

### What is the scope of duty for non-discrimination?
How far can entities be held accountable for and be bound to implement non-discrimination policies?

## Different kinds of morality
### Constitutional
What the [[intersecnotes#^c18601|Constitution]] demands of us.
### Social or Popular
What [[intersecnotes#^ff4c0c|society]] thinks is acceptable.
### Personal
This can align with either constitutional or social morality. Depends on the individual's upbringing, their mentality and philosophy.

**Q:** A school has two buildings. The newbuilding has great amenities. the old building is close to a construction sites. the school decides that students whose first names start A-K study in the old, names L-Z in the new. Is this discrimination?

**A:** Not discrimination because names are not a discriminatory factor. Could be discrimination if their names gave away their community and the A-K crowd had another common factor like caste or race. Or, a better system of allotting the school.

Two camps arise from this question:
1. One camp is based on this system being arbitrary and this being reflected as discrimination.
2. The other camp is focused on how discrimination law usually works. Where things being unfair is not necessarily discriminatory.

When we talk about discrimination law, we have to understand what discrimination means. Arbitrariness does not really map onto discrimination law. It is a standalone doctrine that Indian courts have developed. Indian courts have gone around this by assigning one camp to Article 15 and another to Article 14. US courts have a similar system of **suspect classification** where some discrimination based on on certain traits like race, attract **strict scrutiny**.

**Q:** Health insurance provider charges premium in accordance with health risks. People with disabilities face greater health risks. Therefore, the provider charges disabled people higher premium. Is this discrimination?

**A:** Yes, it probably is discrimination. Disability can be compounded by other factors like poverty. This can lead to intensified discrimination based on a person's disability by pricing them out of healthcare.

# 29.6.21
## Navtej Johar v Union of India
- Held Section 377 to be unconstitutional.
- Several ways to classify protected characteristics:
 	1. Test of Rationality by Gardner.
 	2. Khaitan's architecture of discrimination.
 	3. Intersectional disadvantages.
 	4. Immutable qualities.
 - Thus, protected characteristics generally need a history of discrimination and suffering a disadvantage because of this.
 - Immutable characteristics have a debate as to whether sexual identity is immutable or a fundamental choice. The first is denying them agency and the second would make it legalistically hard to organise around.
 
 Gardner in his [[John Gardner - On the Ground of Her Sexuality.pdf|piece]] talks about two perspectives from which to evaluate discrimination:
 1. What the discriminator was evaluating during the discrimination?
 2. What is the effect of such on the discriminated?
 
 If we go with sex discrimination:
 - It's already in the Constitution.
 - But, it's harder to prove.
 
 If we go with sexual orientation discrimination:
 - It's not in the Constitution.
 - More targetted protection.
 
 **Q:** Should all immutable characteristics be protected or only some?
 
 **A:** Will it also not depend on how complex it is to change such characteristics? Gardner would argue that only valuable choices stemming from valuable options should ideally be protected as fundamental choice.
 
 **Q:** Should an Equality Act only protect traits that are either immutable or the result of a fundamental choice, and are associated with social disadvantage?
 
 **A:** No, today's progressives are tomorrow's conservatives. Society is too dynamic to be concretely categorised. Even something like political opinions may not protected under this narrow construction.

 ## Joseph Shine v Union of India
 - The president called for updating criminal law legislation in 2013.
 - Shine filed a PIL against Section 497 of the IPC and by association, Section 198 of the CrPC.
 - A husband could only file a complaint against the man who had a relationship with his wife and not against the wife, herself.
 - A married woman could not bring a complaint against her husband if he had any relations with an unmarried woman.

When you discriminate against someone based on stereotypes because their behaviour does not comport with the expected standards, it is essentially saying that they are not *real* men, for example.
 
**Q:** What does Hellman mean by demeaning in her [[Deborah Hellman - When is discrimination wrong.pdf|piece]]?

**A:** When you demean someone by insinuating they are not from that community really. When a person is being denied their equal moral worth. There is also the difference between being insulting and demeaning, where a power hierarchy determines whether a word is simply an insult or demeaning. For example, a casteist slur is different from calling someone an idiot.

## Indian Young Lawyers Associations v State of Kerala
- Ban on entry of women of ages 10-50 years of age.
- Lord Ayappa, the deity, is celibate and derives energy from celibacy.
- His male attendants and their spouses endure a penance of 40 days, wear black attire and cut ties with their families.
- Not a denomination because:
	1. Many temples of Lord Ayappa all over the country that allow women.
	2. Not all people who visit the temple are devotees of Lord Ayappa.

> Refer to this [article](https://www.scobserver.in/court-case/sabrimala-temple-entry-case) for a summary of the case.

The court in this case didn't go far enough. If they are going to interfere in religion, they should go all the way and tell people what they should believe in. Not merely skirt around the issue and say just this one issue is the problem that needs to be fixed.

This brings along the question: can a self-respecting Catholic, for example, follow the directions of a court that goes directly against the pronouncements of the Pope, who is God's deputy on Earth? Probably not.

# 8.7.21

## State of Madras v Champakam Dorairajan
- The state had two arguments
	1. Relying on Article 46 to show that there was a duty to help backward classes like SC/STs.
	2. That there was no discrimination based purely on Srinivasan being a Brahmin, but because he had failed to score more marks than the Brahmins being qualified.
- This case led to the introduction of Article 15(4) into the Constitution, to forestall any such challenges to reservation policies in the future.
- Article 16(4) is explicitly included to shield public service, but there was no provision that did the same for public education.
- However, if there is such a provision for public service, why not for public education? Would it not be inconsistent and impractical to exclude public education which can be necessary for some public service from this action?
- To be considered that Ambedkar [[Gautam Bhatia - The Transformative Constitution.pdf#page=19|thought]] that such provisions were exceptions to the general structure of equality as laid out in the Constitution.

**Q:** Did the court decide Champakam Dorairajan correctly?

**A:** The court probably came to the correct conclusion, if a somewhat positivist one. There was no direct legal backing for the stance of the Madras government which relied heavily on the DPSPs, which are not enforceable in court, though they can be considered in court in coming to a judgement. The state also did not challenge the maintainability of the petition because this was a PIL before PILs were even a thing and also said they would reserve a seat for Champakam if she had received a favourable judgement at the HC level.

## Mukesh Kumar v State of Uttarakhand
- The state is not legally bound to provide reservations.

# 13.7.21
## Zoroastrian Cooperative Housing Society v. District Registrar, Cooperative Societies (Urban)
- A housing society challenged the transfer of property to
- Three arguments by the housing society:
	1. Right to association.
	2. Bombay Cooperative Society Act does not prohibit such covenants, which is the parent act.
	3. Article 29, so minorities can protect culture.
- Bhatia argued that cooperative societies are meant to deal with economic activities and not residential matters.
- Court looked almost exclusively at parent act and said it is allowed because these are akin to articles of association.
- Three arguments by the District Registrar:
	1. Section 10 of TPA.
	2. Proviso to Section 4 of Societies Registration Act which says that societies should not be registered if their bylaws are not economically sound.
	3. A hidden argument that societies are supposed to promote fraternal relations, but court says this is only supposed to promote fraternity in the Parsi community. This was not explicitly included, but the court infers this from the respondent's argument.
- Court holds the legislative instrument over the constitutional one.
- Court says that such private discrimination is not explicitly disallowed. In this way, they're interpreting public policy in the light of statutory policy.

**Q:** Does the Zoroastrian Society have the right to prohibit transfers of property to non-Parsis?

**A:** The prohibition can probably stand if it was protecting a cultural or religious site, but for something as secular as housing it makes no sense.

- However, consider freedom of association when it operates to enable a someone to exclude a person from their birthday party and this is perfectly okay. This is a perfectly valid exercise.

# 15.6.21
## Lt. Col. Nitisha v Union of India
**Q:** Is CLAT indirectly discriminatory?

**A:** Not sure about this.
