**Q:** A school has two buildings. The newbuilding has great amenities. the old building is close to a construction sites. the school decides that students whose first names start A-K study in the old, names L-Z in the new. Is this discrimination?

**A:** Not discrimination because names are not a discriminatory factor. Could be discrimination if their names gave away their community and the A-K crowd had another common factor like caste or race. Or, a better system of allotting the school.

Two camps arise from this question:
1. One camp is based on this system being arbitrary and this being reflected as discrimination.
2. The other camp is focused on how discrimination law usually works. Where things being unfair is not necessarily discriminatory.

When we talk about discrimination law, we have to understand what discrimination means. Arbitrariness does not really map onto discrimination law. It is a standalone doctrine that Indian courts have developed. Indian courts have gone around this by assigning one camp to Article 15 and another to Article 14. US courts have a similar system of **suspect classification** where some discrimination based on on certain traits like race, attract **strict scrutiny**.

**Q:** Health insurance provider charges premium in accordance with health risks. People with disabilities face greater health risks. Therefore, the provider charges disabled people higher premium. Is this discrimination?

**A:** Yes, it probably is discrimination. Disability can be compounded by other factors like poverty. This can lead to intensified discrimination based on a person's disability by pricing them out of healthcare.
