**How is labour not a commodity?**
- You can pick and choose from different labour providers.
- There can be different qualities of labour required for different jobs.
- Labour stems from human beings who need a certain dignity and quality of life to function appropriately.
- You can treat a non-living commodity, like a pen, in any way you see fit.
- But, human beings need to be treated differently.
- So, even if people want to offer their labour for a certain amount, if it is below a minimum, that is disallowed.

**Why do we need to work?**
- There is a need to work on the part of people.
- To improve economic and social standing.
- Because society is structured in terms of economic mechanisms.
- By selling labour, you can advance your own cause and improve your life.
- Markets are needed to further your life, but markets also need to be regulated to protect humans.

- Labour law does not protect every single worker. The protections are quite narrow.
- It was assumed that independent contractors could adequately protect their own interests, unlike employees, so they are typically not included under labour law.
