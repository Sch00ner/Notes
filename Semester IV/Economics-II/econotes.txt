-Only the functioning of a well developed capitalist economy is explained by the established theories of macroeconomics.

National Income Accounts
-Official estimate of the productive economic activity in one fiscal year.
-Productive economic activity is the generation of utility that can be sold on the market.
-How National Income is accounted from different perspectives?

4.12.20

-Current income in a fiscal year is a Flow variable.
-Expenditure in fiscal year is accounted for in the current account.
-Any payment made towards the purchase of an asset like a house, car etc. will be accounted for in the Capital account.
-Inflows and outflows of Stock variable are accounted for in the Capital account
-Stock variable is

Gross National Product
-Total value of all finished goods and services produced by domestic production factors calculated at market prices.
-Net National Product at market price is GNP - Depreciation.
-Fund that is set aside by a firm to replace existing machinery is known as Capital Consumption Allowance (CCA).

Foreign Exchange
-Market will determine the value of different currencies.
-Lets say I want to buy an Apple Watch straight from the US. In that case, by using my credit card I am purchasing 1000USD by paying 70,000INR which then gets transferred to Apple. Provided the import demand elasticity is elastic the import demand curve is downward sloping and the demand for Apple Watch will decrease.
-Money value of dollar demand will increase provided the demand elasticity is greater than 1.
-Lets say the US imports basmati from India. If the price of basmati falls and the import demand elasticity of basmati is more than 1, the ensuing demand is more than enough to get people to buy more. Thus, Americans will use more USD to buy INR and the supply of USD in India will increase.
-Thus, an equilibrium is reached where the demand curve for dollars and the supply curve for dollars intersects in the positive quadrant of the price-quantity space. Then there will be no reason for the exchange rate to change unless there is an external shock.
-When the interest rate is increased in India, capital inflow will increase to take advantage of the higher interest rate compared to the US. Americans will sell off dollars for rupees to lend to Indians, increasing the supply of dollars. Since the supply curve for dollars now shifts to the right, the price of USD will decrease in INR.
-Lets say the government increases the budget of MNREGA and this increases the demand for automobiles. The government borrows more money to increase the budget, this pushes up the interest rate. Americans sell dollars for rupees to take advantage of higher interest rates increasing the supply of dollars. Since India imports crude, with the increased supply of dollars we can buy in more volume reducing the per unit prices of oil barrels. This will push down the price of petrol in India and lead to growth in the automobile sector.

Influential works:
	1. Adam Smith - Wealth of Nations, 1776
	2. David Ricardo - Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, 1817
	3. Alfred Marshall - Principles of Economics, 1819
-Smith and Ricardo argued for free trade between nations compared to the mercantilism observed before.
-Factors of interest for classical macroeconomic scholars:
	1.Aggregate level of output.
	2.Level of employment.
	3.Determination of real wage.
	4.Interest rate.
	5.Money wage rate.
	6.Absolute price level of commodities.

The 3 Pillars of CLassical Macroeconomics:
-Say's Law (Jean-Baptiste Say): Supply creates its own demand. Production of goods or services requires generation of factor income in the form of wages, rents, equipment. This income is spread to the people who now have more disposable income which drives up demand for goods or services which are being produced.
-Wage Price Flexibility: If there is any excess demand/supply in a market, the market instantaneously adjusts to return to a equilibrium.
-Perfect Competition exists in every market:
	1.Complete and perfect knowledge on behalf of all actors.
	2.Free entry to the market.
	3.Mobility of labour and capital.
	4.Many competitors in the market.
	5.Homogeneity of goods.

11.1.21

-The reality of the Great Depression refuted the principles of classical macroeconomics.
-Classical theory says that anyone who wants to work at the market clearing wage rate will find a job. However, there was massive unemployment during the GD.
-Keynesian theory explained these deficiencies well.
-Keynes showed that underemployment equilibrium would hold in a real life oligopolistic market.
-An important principle of classical theory that governments should not interfere in markets was severely challenged because of the great depression.
-For a perfectly competitive market, a price ceiling would be disastrous.

14.1.21

In order to find the labour supply curve, 
-Whenever there is excess demand in the labour market, real wage rises. Whenever there is excess demand in the labour market, real wage falls.

18.1.21

Aggregate Demand
-Factor income in an economy is equal to the output produced in an economy.
-The supply of money is also a factor in determining aggregate demand.
-Professor Irving Fisher first talked about the quantity theory of money.
-Quantity theory Equation of Exchange: An identity where the price level multiplied by the index of real expenditure is equal to the stock of money multiplied by the velocity of money.
-Cambridge version of Quantity Theory: Money demanded by the citizens is equal to the multiple of proportion of national income that people want to hold, the national output and the average price.
Quantity Theory of Money: https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/theories-of-money/quantity-theory-of-money-with-diagram/6387

20.1.21

-Money wage and price are instantaneously adjustable. The ratio of W/P will always be a constant.
-The IS-LM model: https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_economics-theory-through-applications/s35-36-the-is-lm-model.html
-If there is a technological innovation comes to the market, the supply of goods will increase with the same amount of labour. Thus, the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right but the aggregate demand remains the same. The nominal wage falls but the real wage stays the same. Full employment is still in effect.

-Macro and Micro are highly related. For example, if there is a tariff on crude petroleum it can be analysed by a micro framework. But, macro frameworks are needed to understand the knock on effects on the economy.

KEYNESIAN MODEL

-Keynes was a technocrat compared to the Smiths and Marxes of the world who were philosophers and scientists. He had a concrete problem in hand and needed a solution to it.
-This problem was the Great Depression which was the result of a Wall Street crash in June 1928. It led to massive unemployment in capitalist economies.
-A lot of history.

28.1.21

-Kuznets showed that the Gini coefficient was rising along with GDP but started falling after 1915, which shows that inequality was falling.
-Gini coefficient is shown by a Lorenz Curve. (https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/lorenz-curve/)
-Around 1915, WW1 spurred greater empployment and a rise in wages. The explanation from leftist economists is that the capitalists from different nations were fighting against each other and profit rates started falling. Thomas Piketty is one of the main proponents of this.
-Inequality spurs conflict in a society more than a society that is uniformly poor. Extreme inequality agitates people and this was used by fascists to whip up a frenzy against the Jews.
-However, after 1945 capital was reunited again and equality started worsening.
-The Middle East became the new playground for capitalism because of vast oil reserves. This ignited a lot of conflict based around ethnic and territorial differences.

30.1.21

-The dumping ground for industrial output were the colonies, who resisted this. This is one of the reasons that Say's law was not holding true anymore.
-Such resistance was seen in India and was a major reason for demand drying up for industrial goods in the West.

-Keynes says that as income rises consumption also rises proportionally, but not matching the rise in income as some is converted into savings.
-Keynes' income hypothesis is known as the Absolute Income hypothesis.

Assumptions in the Absolute Income hypothesis:
	1. Aggregate consumption (C) is a fairly stable rising function of disposable income. Thus, C = f(Y-T)
	Y: Real GDP
	T: Taxation
	2. The slope of the consumption function is called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and it lies between 0 and 1.
	3. At all levels of income the average propensity to consume (APC = C/Y) is greater than MPC.
	4. APC is a decreasing function of income.
-If the consumption function is linear there will be an upward sloping curve. In this case, the APC is calculated by joining points on the curve to the origin. The tan function of these angles will always be less than 1 and will keep getting flatter the higher you go on the curve. This bears out the assumption that people will save more with rising income.

Simple Keynesian Model:
-Only the goods market is considered in this model.
-The price of goods is fixed because of strong excess capacity.
-The capital, loan, money and labour markets are not relevant in this model. This is because all the prices have been driven down to their minimum.
-The investment function is not included because there is no further investment during the Great Depression as the rate of interest is flat for about 8 years at this point.
-If price is constant at $15, there is no real reason to include the price in calculations. If the price is normalised to $1, then revenue will equal the output.

Bond Markets

-In the goods market, Say's law has clearly failed.

Aggregate supply = Aggregate demand + Excess inventory
=> AS = AD + ∆I

-Demonetisation did not significantly impact the supply of black money in the economy.
-While there was an initial spurt in digital payments, it has come back down to pre-demonetisation levels.
-Gita Gopinathan said it led to the GDP shrinking by 2%
-45 year high unemployment during demonetisation.
-Price of crude was cheaper than during UPA regime, but due to high taxes the price of petrol was higher during this period, which retarded GDP growth.
-Nirmala Sitharaman reduced the effective corporate tax rate to 25.17% from 34.9%
-This reduction in corporate tax led to a deficit of 1,45,000 crore in tax collection.
-However, this was not really a supply side problem, so the economy didn't grow as much as was projected due to these tax cuts.
