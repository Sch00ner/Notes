-Only the functioning of a well developed capitalist economy is explained by the established theories of macroeconomics.

National Income Accounts
-Official estimate of the productive economic activity in one fiscal year.
-Productive economic activity is the generation of utility that can be sold on the market.
-How National Income is accounted from different perspectives?

4.12.20

-Current income in a fiscal year is a Flow variable.
-Expenditure in fiscal year is accounted for in the current account.
-Any payment made towards the purchase of an asset like a house, car etc. will be accounted for in the Capital account.
-Inflows and outflows of Stock variable are accounted for in the Capital account
-Stock variable is

Gross National Product
-Total value of all finished goods and services produced by domestic production factors calculated at market prices.
-Net National Product at market price is GNP - Depreciation.
-Fund that is set aside by a firm to replace existing machinery is known as Capital Consumption Allowance (CCA).

Foreign Exchange
-Market will determine the value of different currencies.
-Lets say I want to buy an Apple Watch straight from the US. In that case, by using my credit card I am purchasing 1000USD by paying 70,000INR which then gets transferred to Apple. Provided the import demand elasticity is elastic the import demand curve is downward sloping and the demand for Apple Watch will decrease.
-Money value of dollar demand will increase provided the demand elasticity is greater than 1.
-Lets say the US imports basmati from India. If the price of basmati falls and the import demand elasticity of basmati is more than 1, the ensuing demand is more than enough to get people to buy more. Thus, Americans will use more USD to buy INR and the supply of USD in India will increase.
-Thus, an equilibrium is reached where the demand curve for dollars and the supply curve for dollars intersects in the positive quadrant of the price-quantity space. Then there will be no reason for the exchange rate to change unless there is an external shock.
-When the interest rate is increased in India, capital inflow will increase to take advantage of the higher interest rate compared to the US. Americans will sell off dollars for rupees to lend to Indians, increasing the supply of dollars. Since the supply curve for dollars now shifts to the right, the price of USD will decrease in INR.
-Lets say the government increases the budget of MNREGA and this increases the demand for automobiles. The government borrows more money to increase the budget, this pushes up the interest rate. Americans sell dollars for rupees to take advantage of higher interest rates increasing the supply of dollars. Since India imports crude, with the increased supply of dollars we can buy in more volume reducing the per unit prices of oil barrels. This will push down the price of petrol in India and lead to growth in the automobile sector.

Influential works:
	1. Adam Smith - Wealth of Nations, 1776
	2. David Ricardo - Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, 1817
	3. Alfred Marshall - Principles of Economics, 1819
-Smith and Ricardo argued for free trade between nations compared to the mercantilism observed before.
-Factors of interest for classical macroeconomic scholars:
	1.Aggregate level of output.
	2.Level of employment.
	3.Determination of real wage.
	4.Interest rate.
	5.Money wage rate.
	6.Absolute price level of commodities.

The 3 Pillars of CLassical Macroeconomics:
-Say's Law (Jean-Baptiste Say): Supply creates its own demand. Production of goods or services requires generation of factor income in the form of wages, rents, equipment. This income is spread to the people who now have more disposable income which drives up demand for goods or services which are being produced.
-Wage Price Flexibility: If there is any excess demand/supply in a market, the market instantaneously adjusts to return to a equilibrium.
-Perfect Competition exists in every market:
	1.Complete and perfect knowledge on behalf of all actors.
	2.Free entry to the market.
	3.Mobility of labour and capital.
	4.Many competitors in the market.
	5.Homogeneity of goods.

11.1.21

-The reality of the Great Depression refuted the principles of classical macroeconomics.
-Classical theory says that anyone who wants to work at the market clearing wage rate will find a job. However, there was massive unemployment during the GD.
-Keynesian theory explained these deficiencies well.
-Keynes showed that underemployment equilibrium would hold in a real life oligopolistic market.
-An important principle of classical theory that governments should not interfere in markets was severely challenged because of the great depression.
-For a perfectly competitive market, a price ceiling would be disastrous.

14.1.21

In order to find the labour supply curve, 
-Whenever there is excess demand in the labour market, real wage rises. Whenever there is excess demand in the labour market, real wage falls.

18.1.21

Aggregate Demand
-Factor income in an economy is equal to the output produced in an economy.
-The supply of money is also a factor in determining aggregate demand.
-Professor Irving Fisher first talked about the quantity theory of money.
-Quantity theory Equation of Exchange: An identity where the price level multiplied by the index of real expenditure is equal to the stock of money multiplied by the velocity of money.
-Cambridge version of Quantity Theory: Money demanded by the citizens is equal to the multiple of proportion of national income that people want to hold, the national output and the average price.
Quantity Theory of Money: https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/theories-of-money/quantity-theory-of-money-with-diagram/6387

20.1.21

-Money wage and price are instantaneously adjustable. The ratio of W/P will always be a constant.
-The IS-LM model: https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_economics-theory-through-applications/s35-36-the-is-lm-model.html
-If there is a technological innovation comes to the market, the supply of goods will increase with the same amount of labour. Thus, the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right but the aggregate demand remains the same. The nominal wage falls but the real wage stays the same. Full employment is still in effect.

-Macro and Micro are highly related. For example, if there is a tariff on crude petroleum it can be analysed by a micro framework. But, macro frameworks are needed to understand the knock on effects on the economy.

KEYNESIAN MODEL

-Keynes was a technocrat compared to the Smiths and Marxes of the world who were philosophers and scientists. He had a concrete problem in hand and needed a solution to it.
-This problem was the Great Depression which was the result of a Wall Street crash in June 1928. It led to massive unemployment in capitalist economies.
-A lot of history.

28.1.21

-Kuznets showed that the Gini coefficient was rising along with GDP but started falling after 1915, which shows that inequality was falling.
-Gini coefficient is shown by a Lorenz Curve. (https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/lorenz-curve/)
-Around 1915, WW1 spurred greater empployment and a rise in wages. The explanation from leftist economists is that the capitalists from different nations were fighting against each other and profit rates started falling. Thomas Piketty is one of the main proponents of this.
-Inequality spurs conflict in a society more than a society that is uniformly poor. Extreme inequality agitates people and this was used by fascists to whip up a frenzy against the Jews.
-However, after 1945 capital was reunited again and equality started worsening.
-The Middle East became the new playground for capitalism because of vast oil reserves. This ignited a lot of conflict based around ethnic and territorial differences.

30.1.21

-The dumping ground for industrial output were the colonies, who resisted this. This is one of the reasons that Say's law was not holding true anymore.
-Such resistance was seen in India and was a major reason for demand drying up for industrial goods in the West.

-Keynes says that as income rises consumption also rises proportionally, but not matching the rise in income as some is converted into savings.
-Keynes' income hypothesis is known as the Absolute Income hypothesis.

Assumptions in the Absolute Income hypothesis:
	1. Aggregate consumption (C) is a fairly stable rising function of disposable income. Thus, C = f(Y-T)
	Y: Real GDP
	T: Taxation
	2. The slope of the consumption function is called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and it lies between 0 and 1.
	3. At all levels of income the average propensity to consume (APC = C/Y) is greater than MPC.
	4. APC is a decreasing function of income.
-If the consumption function is linear there will be an upward sloping curve. In this case, the APC is calculated by joining points on the curve to the origin. The tan function of these angles will always be less than 1 and will keep getting flatter the higher you go on the curve. This bears out the assumption that people will save more with rising income.

Simple Keynesian Model:
-Only the goods market is considered in this model.
-The price of goods is fixed because of strong excess capacity.
-The capital, loan, money and labour markets are not relevant in this model. This is because all the prices have been driven down to their minimum.
-The investment function is not included because there is no further investment during the Great Depression as the rate of interest is flat for about 8 years at this point.
-If price is constant at $15, there is no real reason to include the price in calculations. If the price is normalised to $1, then revenue will equal the output.

-In the goods market, Say's law has clearly failed.

Aggregate supply = Aggregate demand + Excess inventory
=> AS = AD + ∆I

-Demonetisation did not significantly impact the supply of black money in the economy.
-While there was an initial spurt in digital payments, it has come back down to pre-demonetisation levels.
-Gita Gopinathan said it led to the GDP shrinking by 2%
-45 year high unemployment during demonetisation.
-Price of crude was cheaper than during UPA regime, but due to high taxes the price of petrol was higher during this period, which retarded GDP growth.
-Nirmala Sitharaman reduced the effective corporate tax rate to 25.17% from 34.9%
-This reduction in corporate tax led to a deficit of 1,45,000 crore in tax collection.
-However, this was not really a supply side problem, so the economy didn't grow as much as was projected due to these tax cuts.

-Due to diminishing marginal returns, the growth of poor countries is higher than rich countries. This is the doctrine of absolute convergence.
-However, Robert Solo himself discarded this in favour of the doctrine of conditional convergence.
-The reason for the Great Depression was inadequacy of demand.

-Development economists from the 1930s discussed how to get colonies out of their low level equilibrium trap.
-If an economy is poor, for various reasons, like low mineral wealth, no arable land etc.
-In the medieval period, it was the ruling class were affected with the change in rulers during invasions. The rural proletariat was not really that affected by such change in rulers.
-There was a stark difference when the East India Company came here. The EIC simply wanted to use India as both a factor market and a goods market.
-There was a profit motive for setting up colonies.
-Post independence there was a constraint on resources with a huge population to feed.
-The Cold War was also at its peak and the US and USSR both used former colonies to further their objective.
-India had somewhat more bargaining power due to the sheer size of the market.
-When a country is poor, they are caught in the poverty trap. They will be unable to save up enough capital to progress. Because they don't have enough capital to access resources to move up, it will deepen their poverty.
-Economists say that these countries need a big push, in the form of government expenditures, that creates forward and backward linkages.
-For example, if investment in steel is done, it will have a backward link to power generation and mining iron ore and a forward link to many industries that utilise steel like construction and manufacturing.
-INR was artificially overvalued during the 80s. This led to a boom in import and led to the balance of payments to crisis.
-The RBI deposited almost 600 tons of gold as collateral with the Bank of England to get a loan from the IMF.
-This led to the measures by Manmohan Singh. On 1 July, 1991, he devalued the INR by 10% and again on 3 July by another 11%.

-Budgeted expenditure for government in FY20 = 30.42 lakh crore rupees
-Post Covid, revised estimate of BE = 34.5 lakh crore rupees.
-So additional 4.08 lakh crore went into the economy as fiscal stimulus owing to the crisis.
-An additional 50k crore went straight to MNREGA.
-Budgeted expenditure for government in FY21 = 34 lakh crore rupees
-Assuming a 3% inflation rate, to maintain the same level of BE as last year it would have to be 35.5 lakh crore.
-In 2019-20, MNREGA expenditure was 71,686 crores
-In 2020-21, the RE on MNREGA is 1,11,500 crores
-In 2021-22, the BE on MNREGA is 73,000 crores

LM locus(Liquidity Money locus)LM curve is defined as the locus of Combinationsof Y and R for which the money market is atequilibrium. Once we talk about the money marketequilibrium, we need to understand both the supplyside and the demand side.To start with, when we deal with the basic LMmodel, we will take a simplistic assumption that theentire money supply is exogenously determined bythe Central Bank, this is a short run model, goodsprice is constant in the short term, so the realmoney supply also becomes an exogenous variablein this system. This is for the supply side.Demand side of the money marketThe money demand functionWhy is money demanded? As a medium ofexchange, a metric for the purpose of evaluation ofintrinsic value of a commodity and used to
exchange different goods, so medium of exchange.Also there is the precautionary balance, a store ofliquid money kept for exigencies, which hasbecome low with the rise in credit and debit cards,provided the technical situation of your area. So inrural areas liquid cash for exigencies may be apossible motive for holding money.These are basically both used as a medium ofexchange. We shall thus club the transactiondemand and the precaution demand and have theL1 function of money demand.There is a basic assumption that money will havevalue at the end of the depression, as promissorynotes issued by the Central Bank in the form ofmoney may not be honoured, Value of money has a certainty when the situationis more stable, but then also there is the questionof inflation. The money gives you certainty with respect topurchasing power, but this is related to futuretransaction demand. What is the speculative function of money? 
How can money store some kind of value in itself?Money is being used as a bond, or some kind ofdebt or investment instrument. During Depression,the market rate of interest goes to almost zero,making the cost of holding bonds very high. If Ihave some money and I want to generate someincome from it, I can roll the money in the marketby purchasing some bonds or stocks. This means Iam basically lending money to a firm. A bond isbasically collection of the initial capital for a firm, byway of issuing debt instrument bond, which has aface value, which is the amount written on the bondwhich shows the amount of money lent to thebusiness entity against the bond. Say I float 5 lakh bonds each worth 1000 rs. Facevalue is Rs 1000. So someone needs to pay me Rs1000 to get the bond. When all the bonds arepurchased, 50 CR is raised. What is the benefit thatthat purchaser have? At the end of the maturityperiod, the money will be returned and so will thebonds. But why will the buyer part with theirliquidity? The incentive for such is known as the
yield of the bond. A certain amount of money willbe paid to the person holding the bonds regularly,usually annually, as long as the maturity period.Thus, a regular annual income will be assured. Thebond is generating a stream of income over time.How will the buyer value this stream of income? Incomparison with the market rate of interest. Theinterest will probably be comparable to the marketrate of interest, if not a little bit at a premium. Thepresent valuation of the bond depends on theoption or second best option, but I can alsogenerate the stream of income by putting thatmoney in a commercial bank. In that case, how willthe buyer value the stream of income that isgenerated? What stream of income will be generated if thebuyer chooses a FD account with a commercialbank, Liquidity is higher for bonds, so the same rate ofinterest can actually be charged. Second channel of income generation from bank interms of capital gain. If the money is lent at a time
when the rate is high and prices low, a capital gainis possible when the prices are high, by selling it offon the bond market. Present valuation of the bond=stream of incomethat could have been generated in an FD account ofa commercial bank. At the end of 1 year interestaccrued is 10000. The 1 lac becomes 1*(1+r)*1 lac.So 110000 at the end of one year. What will be theamount accruing at the end of second year.121000....at the 3nd of the 10th year, incomeaccruing will be 1 lac*(1+r^10). How would a buyerlook at the present value of the bond from me.What the buyer gets is 10000 rs per year. She willhave to wait for a year to get 10000. Thus, a cost oftrading is associated when we are looking at astream of income generated over time. Yield at theend of the first year= (Opportunity cost = exponential. When valuing total stream of income, totaldiscounted value= 1st years yield/1+r +2nd/(1+r)^2+...+10th years yield(1+r)^10+ principal. If there is a fixed yield, Y1=Y2=Y3.. =Y bar. 
Present discounted value of the bond= Y bar/1+rfor 10 termsfor 10 terms.

Screenshot: 

Present discounted value of the bond= Y bar/1+rfor 10 termsfor 10 terms. Thus present value is calculated as such. Price, yield and market rate are related. Yield isconstant in a perpetuity. Thus, the inverserelationship between rate and price is established. Thus cost of holding bonds becomes very high so
Thus, cost of holding bonds becomes very high, sovery low yield for bond. Thus better to hold liquidcash. There is also a chance where before the endof the maturity period liquid cash is needed, can begot by selling the bond. The price of bond may godown if the market recovers. Thus, a capital loss isbeing made.Return=r (market rate of interest prevailing at thetime of sale of the bond) +Expected price ofbond-current price of bond *100/current price ofbond(Expected capital gain).  *expressed in percentages*
