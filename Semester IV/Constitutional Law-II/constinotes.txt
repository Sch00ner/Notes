The Cost of Rights distinction
-Is there any economic cost to providing rights?
-As a state do I have the economic resources to secure the rights?
-Some rights might have a huge capital commitment to secure at the start and some may not require much economic capital at all, like freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion.

The Positive/Negative Rights distinction
-Primary target of the state is to make sure that these rights are not violated either by the state or anyone else.
-In some other rights, there is a positive duty on part of the state to secure the right, like Right to Food, unlike the right to free speech where the state has to ensure that no one violates it.
-Some rights thus need continuous action on part of the state to ensure and some only require enforcement at specific times to secure them.

-Non-state actors may also be bound by such rights.
-The rights which do not require any significant economic input are civil and political rights, like freedom of speech and religion. The rights which require significant economic input are typically known as economic, social and cultural rights.
-The Americans favoured civil and political rights and the Russians favoured economic, social and cultural rights.
-Thus, we got two human rights treaties in the 60s. The ICCPR, backed by the Americans and the ICESCR backed by the Russians.
-So, since the ICCPR did not require any significant economic input, it could be implemented upon ratification of the treaty itself. However, the ICESCR stated that the treaty members were to gradually work towards realisation of these rights.
-India very cleverly put the economic, social and cultural rights in the DPSP, while having the civil and political rights as FRs. This pleased both the Americans and Russians.
-However, the DPSPs are not enforceable in law. But, progressive realisation is possible like how the Indian state is building houses for people or how UCC is being promised.

4.12.20

-When right to life or personal liberty was initially guaranteed, no one really thought that it could include ecosoc rights. However, ecosoc rights have slowly become infused into these civpol right like life and personal liberty.
-In the Irish constitution, Directive Principles of Social Policy are not cognisable in court. In India, the DPSPs are not enforceable in court. This means that courts in Ireland will not even acknowledge it, while courts in India can hear arguments based upon the DPSPs to enforce other rights.
-State of Madras v Champakam Dorairajan 1951: Madras had provided for an affirmative action for SC/ST etc. Since Art 14 and 15(1) existed in its original state, this was challenged because discrimination on the basis of caste was unconstitutional. The State countered that it was only trying to fulfill the DPSPs. But, the SC said that the DPSPs were not to be acknowledged in courts under the mistaken impression that the situation in India was the same as in Ireland, where Directive Principles of Social Policy were not cognisable. However,in India the DPSPs are not enforceable, but that does not mean that arguments related to them are completely prohibited from court.
-Mohd Hanif Quraishi v State of Bihar 1958: The first challenge against the ban of cow slaughter. They were in the business of slaughterhouses and said their right to practice religion and carry on their own business was being infringed. The court said rights could be reasonably restricted based upon public interest. Since, there is a DPSP saying that the State should ensure cows, milch and draught cattle slaughter should be restricted, there is reasonable ground to uphold the ban. However, it could not be a blanket ban and reasonable classifications need to be made, such as cows which are still producing milk.
-In Re Kerala Educational Bill 1958:

8.12.20

-Courts used to say that reservations should not exceed 50% because the exception should not be bigger than the rule.
-In N.M. Thomas, the court moved away from the above position. This is because reservation is not the exception to the rule of equality, rather they are in furtherance of the rule of equality.

9.12.20

-DP Joshi vs Madhya Bharat(State of MP later)1955: MP had reserved seats in medical seats and Joshi challenged this saying that this was discrimination based on place of birth. Court said that this was based on residency and not place of birth. MP justified it by saying that medical colleges are heavily subsidised by the state government and thus, if the students from the state are prioritised it is not a problem. For example, if a student from WB studies in a MP medical college and goes back to practice in WB, MP sees no benefit.

-BN Rao was a major architect of the Constitution. He went to the US to check out the Bill of Righst because he was fascinated with it.
-The 5th and 14th amendments to the Bill of Rights say that no one can be deprived of their liberty except by the "due process of law".
-Article 31 of the Japanese Constitution however used the term "procedure established by law" which is what we adopted.

-AK Gopalan was placed under house arrest under the Preventive Detention Act. He was not given a reason and no hearing was scheduled. Thus, Gopalan through Nambiar pleads to the SC. Nambiar asked whether any law could deprive people of their liberty just because it is an established procedure of law. Nambiar recounts a story from Rochester in the UK where people were put to death by being fried alive in oil for the crime of theft. With this, Nambiar illustrated how the State can run amok and make a mockery of democracy. Secondly, Nambiar argued that mere physical right to live cannot be the full extent of Art. 21, it must include the right to be free to live our lives to a reasonable extent. However, besides Justice Fazl Ali all the judges of the SC declined to do anything about it.
-In Maneka Gandhi, Bhagwati made sure to lay out that procedure established by law needs to be fair, just and reasonable, echoing Fazalali in the Gopalan case.

11.12.20

-In Mithu v State of Punjab the court went beyond procedure and said that even the law has to be fair, reasonable and just.  It was argued that Sec. 303 of IPC goes against Art. 14 because the punishment was different for a person who was already under life imprisonment and then commits a murder, compared to someone who has only been convicted for murder.

-Mohini Jain v State of Rajasthan: Court said RTE is included in Right to Life under Art. 21. The court realised its mistake later because anyone can ask the State to fund their education from primary to doctorate which will go beyond the capacity of the State to fulfill.
-So, in Unni Krishnan v State of AP 1993, the court restricted it to basic education from 6-14 years of age. Then, Art. 45 was changed and Art. 21A inserted to make this a FR.

14.12.20

FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

-Outlined in Art. 51A of the Constitution.
-If there is an IPL match happening and the National Anthem is being played, can I be prosecuted for not standing up? Or, for not having a scientific temper? Not really.
-FDs are similar to DPSPs. They are not enforceable and was not envisioned to be so.
-So why do we have FDs?
-In the CA, some advocated for a duty based narrative in the Constitution. This was backed up by the Vedas and the Upanishads which talk about various duties.
-However, others felt that the Constitution was voluminous enough as it was and only added it as a non-enforceable section.
-In Sachidananda Pandey v State of WB, involved the construction of the Taj Bengal hotel. The petitioner argued that since the Alipore zoo was in a green zone and the big hotel would block the path of the migratory birds. The Tatas said that the hotel will be built in a sustainable way so as to not disturb the environment. The petitoners raised Art. 51A(g) because every person should protect the environment. The SC said because there is a FD and a DPSP involved, it will be brought to teh notice of the State. However, after the State has evaluated it in a bona fide manner, the court will not involve itself further. Basically, relevant but not really.
-Chowksy case: Deepak Mishra heard this case where Chowksy was offended by the national anthem scene in Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gam. Mishra agreed and said it was insulting to the national anthem to be sung in a fake British accent. However, the movie was already out and a lot of money was riding on it, so it was left untouched. But, Chowksy approached Mishra to ensure that the national anthem be played before movies with the uniform tune and aniumation that we have today. Mishra called this a display of constitutional patriotism.

15.12.20

FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

Two basic fundamentals about the fundamental rights. Firstly. Most FRs have a negative rights connotation. Distinguished between Civil Rights and Economic, Social Rights. When we have couched the rights in negative language, we are assuming that there is a basic understanding of all citizens about their rights. If there is any denial, the citizen knows where to approach. Isn’t this expecting too much, given our literacy level? This led to a more positive rights approach by Indian courts. The court realised that if rights are limited to a situation in which the citizens can approach only when there is a denial, this is not desirable. 
Second premise- FRs are vertically enforceable (against the state). This is not an absolutely true statement- some FRs are horizontally applicable (against private citizens). Case of Article 17 (Prevention of untouchability). It is essentially a practice by individuals. So horizontally applicable. 
Similarly, right against exploitation (Article 23). Even if a private employer exploits, then applicable. 
Article 15 (2) and 15 (1)- 
15. (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. (vertically applicable)
(2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to— (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment; or (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public. (Horizontally applicable)

Sir, what if instead of excluding a group based on the mentioned criteria, you include one community excluding everyone else? – Mostly based on reasonable classification. Prima facie, this is also discrimination.

16.12.20

Article 12
-Definition of State is inclusive and not exhaustive.
-This definition is limited to Part III.
-University of Madras v Shanta Bai: A case first asked whether the University of Madras is part of State. The court decided that it was not. The court decided this on the principle of ejusdem generis and the common thread among State bodies was found to be that State bodies are supposed to be performing sovereign functions. Since, the university was under the authority of the Education Ministry and not autonomous in its functioning, it could not be said to be performing as a sovereign body.
-Rajasthan Electricity Board v Mohan Lal: All statutory bodies would be counted as "other authorities" according to this case. This established the new standard and did away with the University of Madras ruling.

18.12.20

-Sukhdev v Bhagat Ram: The issue was whether statutory corporations like LIC, ONGC, IFCI are State. CJI Ray, Chandrachud and Gupta give 3 tests to find out whether are State or not:
    1. They are statutory bodies.
    2. They have statutory power to make binding rules and regulations.
    3. They are subject to a pervasive governmental control.
-Justice Mathew gave 2 more tests in his concurring opinion:
    1. Whether the body is an instrumentality or an agent of the State.
    2. Whether a body performs functions that can be called public functions.
-Sabhajit Tiwari v UoI: Issue was whether the CSIR could be counted as State. The court said that it was not. The court reasoned that since the CSIR was a society registered under the Societies' Registration Act and not a statutory body, it could not be counted as State. Decided by the same bench, but it came to a different conclusion.

21.12.20

-Narmada Bachao Andolan v UoI: Sardar Sarovar dam being erected. Initial stay on the height of the dam because the higher it is, the more displacement and environmental damage. But, the court went on to say that whether the dam was to be built or not was a legislative prerogative. They only asked that rehabiltitation of the displaced people be provided for.

READ THIS: Zoroastrian Co-operative Housing Society Limited and Another v District Registrar Co-operative Societies (Urban) and Others.

-RD Shetty case: International Airports Authority was counted as an instrumentality of the Indian government, so, it would be counted as State.
-Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib: Regiona Engineering College in Srinagar had a system where some marks were allotted to a written test and an interview. Hasia challenged the weightage of the interview process. The SC agreed and said that it was indeed arbitrary. They did this inspite of the fact that it was a registered society, going aginst the precedent of Sabhajit Tiwari. Bhagwati gives a 6 prong criteria to identify a body as State:
    1. One thing is  clear that  if the  entire share  capital  of   the corporation is held by  Government it  would go  a long way towards indicating that the Corporation is an instrumentality or  agency of Government. 
    2. Where the financial assistance  of the  State is so much  as to  meet
    almost entire  expenditure  of  the  corporation,  it  would afford some  indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental  character.
    3. Whether  the corporation   enjoys
    monopoly status  which  is  the  State conferred  or  State protected. 
    4. Existence of deep and pervasive  State   control may afford an indication that the Corporation is a
    state agency or  instrumentality.
    5. If the  functions of  the corporation of public importance and   closely  related  to governmental functions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation an instrumentality or agency of Government.
    6. Specifically, if a department      of Government is  transferred to  a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of this inference of the corporation being an instrumentality or agency of Government.
-Pradeep Kumar Biswas v Indian Institute of Chemical Biology: Ruma Pal J proposed a test which is the current position of law today and it is as follows:
    The question in each case would be whether in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body is financially, functionally and administratively dominated by or under the control of the Government. Such control must be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive. If this is found then the body is a State within Article 12.

22.12.20

We got let off early! Holiday incoming.

4.1.21

Article 13
-What would happen to pre-constitutional and post-constitutional laws? These are dealt with Art.13(1) and Art.13(2), respectively.
-This is reflected in the manner in which both Art.13(1) and Art.13(2) are worded, with the latter being much more forceful and deliberate in its phrasing.
-FRs cannot be retrospectove. Thus, a contravening provision of the IPC, for example, cannot be declared void ab initio. All actions taken under the umbrella of this provision till 26th January, 1950 will stand. This is in contradiction to any law passed after the Constitution comes into force which goes against provisions of Part III.
-State of Bombay v Keshavan Madhava Menon: The Brits made a law, Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, to gag the free press during the nationalist movement. This law continued to be in force even after independence and Menon was arrested again by the government of India. Menon argued that since there are FRs in independent India this law is unconstitutional as it violates Art.19. The court agrees, but refuses to let Menon go because the offence was committed before 26th January, 1950 in 1949. Thus, the conviction stood.
-Doctrine of Severability: When only a portion of a law is excised for being unconstitutional, it is the implementation of this doctrine that makes it possible. For example,Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000 was severed from the rest of this legislation. However, if the legislation as a whole is inextricably linked to the offending provisions, the whole law may need to be struck down.

5.1.21

Doctrine of Eclipse
-When the court says that a law is in violation of FRs, the law remains on the books but cannot be used until that judgement is struck down. This means that the law has been eclipsed.
-This means that the law has ceased to be from the date of violation, i.e., 26th January, 1950.
-Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v State of Madhya Pradesh 1955: A monopoly was created by the state for providing transportation in MP. So, all bus routes were nationalised. However, Art.19(1)(g) guaranteed freedom of trade and occupation and Bhikaji challenged the nationalisation based on this. But, while the case was pending Art.19(6) was introduced via an amendment allowing the State to place reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade and occupation. Bhikaji argued that since the earlier Motor Vehicle law was in contravention of Art.19(1)(g) from 26th January, 1950, it was void from that day. Since the law was already void, Bhikaji argued that a simple constitutional amendment could not revive a law that was void, instead, the government would have to enact a new Motor Vehicle law to impose such restrictions again. Court discusses the doctrine of eclipse. The law was unconstitutional, but that would mean the law was ineffective, not dead. The moment constitutional amendment came in, law get validated and eclipse is removed. So re-enactment not required, law not struck down. In this case, Justice SR Das takes a conservative approach- even though 13 (1) uses void, does not mean law is rendered a nullity. It just means ineffective. Justice SR Das limits the operation of this case to the facts of this case- pre-constitutional law. What about post-constitutional law? Not answered in this case. This created confusion.
-Deep Chand v State of UP: Subba Rao says that Eclipse cannot be used for post-constitutional laws. Subba Rao reasoned that pre-constitutional laws cannot be void ab initio because they operated during a time when no FRs existed, so they could not have violated something that didn't existed. However, post-constitutional laws cannot be conceived if they are in contravention to FRs. Thus, it will lead to a still birth of that law, it will be void ab initio. A subsequent amendment cannot revive something that is already dead.
-State of Gujarat v Sri Ambica Mills 1974: A law was challenged on the ground of Art.19(1)(f) and struck down. However, Justice Mathew posed an interesting question, whether the law was void in its entirety or was it only relatively void? Article 19- a non-citizen does not have it. If we are saying that the law is dead and void ab initio, can we say that the law is void vis-à-vis non-citizens who do not even have Article 19 rights? The law is therefore relatively void- ineffective for people who have those rights and effective for the rest. The moment ‘ineffective’ analogy is used, eclipse is being used according to some scholars (MP Singh). Since the law is not becoming still-born.

6.1.21

Doctrine of Waiver
-Can a person give up any of their rights?
-In the US, the position is that people can give up the rights that are related to their own self and not those for the benefit of society at large.
-In the case of Basheshar Nath v CIT, government provided an amnesty for tax payments and entered into an agreement with Basheshar. He starts paying his EMIs but in another case the SC held the provision which allowed such an agreement was against Art.14 as the basis for choosing which persons would be given amnesty. Basheshar stops paying his EMIs because the scheme was now unconstitutional. The government takes him to court and Setalvad argues that Basheshar had waived his Art.14 rights and was thus, not qualified to take advantage of its protections.Justices Bhagwati and Subba Rao opined that no FR could be waived because India was still too young compared to the US for people to be aware if it was a good trade off. Justice SK Das said that this was not even about waiver and he stuck to the American position on waiver. Justices SR Das and Kapoor say that Art.14 cannot be waived, but they don't comment on the waiving of any other rights.
-Thus, the current position is that you can't waive your FRs.

8.1.21

Definition of laws in Art.13(3)
-Can personal laws be called laws under Art.13?
-Not personal laws that have already been codified, but things like Triple Talaq.
-This is concerned with laws that are not attached to a statute.
-State of Bombay v Narasu Appa Mali: The Bombay Prevention of Bigamous Hindu Marriages Act, 1946 was challenged on multiple grounds. One of them was, that it only stopped Hindus from bigamy but not Muslims. They hold the law to be constitutionally valid. However, Justices Chagla and Gajendragadkar reframed the question as to whether we can intervene in bigmaous Muslim marriages. Can the Shariat be brought under the scrutiny of Art.13? They look at the Government of India Act, where Art.112 mentions customs and personal laws separately so the argument was that they were cleary meant to be separate. Another argument was that the Constitution has provisions specifically banning untouchability and untouchability is part of personal laws, then if personal laws are subject to FRs scrutiny, why would we need a specific provision banning it? The answer given by Gajendragadkar was that personal laws are generally not subject to FRs crutiny except those elements which are so abhorrent that they need to be excised from the general body of personal laws. Gautam Bhatia disagreed and said that banning untouchability specifically was a result of abundant caution.

11.1.21

-Sri Krishna Singh v Mathura Ahir: In this case, a Shudra wanted to join a religious order but the challenge was that only Brahmins could become priests. The Allahabd HC allowed it saying that he left all his caste relationships behind when he wanted to become an ascetic. But, the SC overturned the HC judgement and said that: 
In our opinion, the learned Judge failed to appreciate that Part III of the Constitution does not touch upon the personal laws of the parties. In applying the personal laws of the parties, he could not introduce his own concepts of modern times but should have enforced the law as derived from recognised and authoritative sources of Hindu law, i.e., Smritis and commentaries referred to, as interpreted in the judgments of various High Courts, except where such law is altered by any usage or custom or is modified or abrogated by statute.
-In a lot of these cases, it was a law being challenged which gave legitimacy to a personal law.
-C. Masilamani Mudaliar v. Idol of Sri Swaminathaswami: Personal laws are derived not from the Constitution but from the religious scriptures. The laws thus derived must be consistent with the Constitution lest they become void under Art. 13 if they violate fundamental rights. However, this case is not challenging Narasu Appa Mali but only solidifying the concept that only statutory laws can be challenged.

Triple Talaq
-Nariman played it safe. He struck down the 1937 law insofar as it legitmised all forms of talaq including triple talaq. He didn't scrutinise personal laws with respect to FRs.

-DYC in Sabarimala said:
Custom, usages and personal law have a significant impact on the civil status of individuals. Those activities that are inherently connected with the civil status of individuals cannot be granted constitutional immunity merely because they may have some associational features which have a religious nature. To immunize them from constitutional scrutiny, is to deny the primacy of the Constitution.

13.1.21

Right to Equality and Reservation(Article 14)
Salient points:
1. You must not be treating everyone equally.
2. You must classify people and have no discrimination in the group itself.
3. There must be no over or under inclusion.

18.1.21

-Equal protection before the law is derived from Dicey's Rule of Law theory.
-Criteria for reasonable classification:
    1.Intelligible differentia: Groupings are made based on reasonable and perceptible measures and ensuring that such categorisations don't suffer from under or over inclusion.
    2.Rational nexus with the object: There has to be an ultimate objective you seek to secure. Steps taken must be linked to securing such objective.
    3.Presumption of constitutionality (more a condition for success than a criterion): The intial presumption that what the state has proposed is constitutional to aid in the function of a welfare state.
-Pradeep Tandon case: Court upheld a scheme of reservation in hilly areas but not in villages. The population of a village is too heterogeneous for it to be included in the scheme.
-State of WB v Anwar Ali Sarkar: WB special courts case. Anwar and 49 other unrelated cases were sent to a special court. Anwar challenged this saying it was against Art.14 as other cases like his were tried in ordinary courts under the CrPC. Court ruled that this was against Art.14 as there was no intelligible differntia for the cases being referred to the special court.
-Kathi Raning Rawat v State of Saurashtra: A similar law for special courts was present. However, it was seen that a whole category of cases was referred to the special court. However, there were two crucial differnces with Anwar Ali; first, that it was a whole category of cases was picked compared to particular cases in Anwar Ali, second, there was a preamble in this law which included a reason as to why this law was needed. These two differences made sure that the law was upheld by the court.
-In Re SPecial Courts Bill, 1978: Bill moved by Janata government that all abuse of power during Emergency would be referred to a special court. Court allowed this as Emergency was an extraordinary period of time. However, a flaw in the Bill was also pointed out by the court that cases from February 1975 till the end of Emergency was also included even though the Emergency started in June 1975. Thus, the law was not valid for that period.
-Deepak Sibal v Punjab University: PU had a rule stating that the evening session was only for government and semi-government employees because they had work during the daytime. Sibal challenged this rule and the court said that there was no intelligible difference to discriminate between government, semi-government and other employees who had work during the day.
-DS Nakara v Union of India: New pension scheme launched that wuld be applicable to people who retired on a specific date and onwards. Nakara challenged this saying it was creating a sub-classification within pensioners. The court agreed and said that it should not be based on the date of retirement.

19.1.21

-Sukumar Mukherjee v State of WB: This case made a difference between doctors who were teachers (West Bengal Health Education Services) and doctors who worked in government facilities(West Bengal Health Services). The teachers were not allowed to conduct private practice unless they were hired to teach specialist courses. The state said that teachers are supposed to keep themselves updated and immersed in research, so they should not waste time on private practice. However, Mukherjee countered by saying that practicing doctors also keep themselves updated. But, the court agreed with the state and said that teaching doctors should invest their time in research. However, specialist doctors were an exception because they were contractors and they would refuse to take courses if their own practices were required to be shut down and specialist departments would shut down.
-Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v UOI: The state made a law to specifically take over the Sholapur Spinning Company. Lal argued that his shares were being taken away was a violation of Art.14 as other shareholders in the country were still enjoying their shares. The court disagreed and said that the company was very important to the economy of the nascent country which necessitated the takeover of this company in particular.
-Ameerunnissa Begum v Mahboob Begum: These were two begums of the deceased Nizam of Hyderabad who were disputing the property left over after his death. The court struck down the law resolving this dispute saying that the Nizam was not so special to require a special law and ordinary Muslim law would suffice.
-Air India v Nargesh Mirza: Distinguishes between Air Hostesses (AH) and Air Flight Pursers (AFP). Age of retirement for AFP was 58 years. For AH, it was 35 or their first pregnancy or getting married within 4 years of joining the service, this was Rule 46. Rule 47 said that if she is still in the job at 35 years of age she can be given yearly extensions at the complete discretion of management. The tribunal said that AH has to look young and attractive because they have to deal with temparamental passengers. The case goes to the SC. The SC says that AH and AFP belong to different classes because their job descriptions, promotion structure and retirement ages are different, in a case where the retirement age was under challenge. This is despite their job functions being basically the same. On the pregnancy question, Nariman conceded that retirement at first pregnancy was too harsh and proposed that it be shifted to the third pregnancy. The court agreed because this would avoid population explosion, save the health of the mother and ensure proper upbringing of the children. Rule 47 that said management could provide yearly extensions was also held to be arbitrary and struck down.

20.1.21

Arbitrariness
-Tarunabh Khaitan calls the old equality model Unreasonable Comparison. Here, one compares the way another has been treated and how one's treatment has no nexus with the objective sought to be achieved.
-The new model is called Non-Comparative Unreasonableness, where no comparison with the treatment another is needed.
-EP Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu: Royappa was an acting chief secretary in TN. He was transferred to the Planning Comission first, and then shifted to officer on special duty. He challenged the second transfer under Art.32 and by an amendment to his pleading an Art.14 challenge was also introduced, almost as an afterthought. Justices Ray, and Palekar said that the petition should be dismissed as there was no disadvantage. Bhagwati and the other 2 judges said that Royappa had not been able to prove his disadvantage. However, Bhagwati wrote something in his judgement that turned out to be extremely important:
    Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be ‘cribbed, cabined and confined’ within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies… Where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14…

22.1.21

-Sahara v SEBI (popularly known as Media Guidelines case) mentioned in class but not yet done.
-A critical question asked from the 80s was whether it was restricted to only administrative rules or could be applied to legislation too?
-State of AP v McDowells: This was a liqour ban case. Rohinton Fali Nariman argued that legislation should also be scrutinised on the basis of arbitrariness. The court refused because that would be admitting that substantive due process is available in the country. Nariman pointed out that substantive due process had come up in cases such as Sunil Batra. However, the court said that such cases were only related to Art.21 and refused to extend it beyond that.
-Rajbala v State of Haryana: Law restricting who can stand in elections with various requirements. Chelameshwar quoted McDowell's to say that scrutinising this law was not possible on the ground of arbitrariness as that would amount to acknowledging the existence of substantive due procedure.
-Shayara Bano v UoI: Triple Talaq was struck down on the ground of manifest arbitrariness by Nariman, who  is now a judge.

25.1.21

Section 377 and Homosexuality

Navtej Johar
-Justice Indu Malhotra and Justice Shah talked about sexual orientation.
-DYC said that the whole idea of natural and unnatural offences is premised upon a very majoritarian bias. For example, death is natural but that does not mean it is desirable.
-Mishra said that there is no rational nexus is not satisfied as it doesn't really protect women and children.
-DYC said that the intelligible differentia is also absent as there is no difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals.
-Malhotra said that basing distinctions upon factors out of one's control cannot be the basis for any kind of intelligible classification.
-All of the judges found that Section 377 was manifestly arbitrary.

Joseph Shine
-Case about decriminalisation of adultery.

	Justness postulates equality. In consonance with constitutional morality, substantive equality is “directed at eliminating individual, institutional and systemic discrimination against disadvantaged groups which effectively undermines their full and equal social, economic, political and cultural participation in society.” To move away from a formalistic notion of equality which disregards social realities, the Court must take into account the impact of the rule or provision in the lives of citizens. The primary enquiry to be undertaken by the Court towards the realisation of substantive equality is to determine whether the provision contributes to the subordination of a disadvantaged group of individuals.

27.1.21

Articles 15 and 16
-Art.16 disallows discrimintion based on descent while Art.15 does not.
-Art.15 does not include residence as a ground for non-discrimination but Art.16 includes it in the case of public employment.
-So domicile in educational institutes are allowed but not in public employment.

29.1.21

Differences between Articles 15 and 16
-Socially and Educationally Backward Classes(SEBC) are different from SC/ST as defined in Art.15(4).
-Art.16(4) talks directly about reservations in public employment and only singles out backward classes and not SEBC. Also, Art.15(4) is not concerned with adequate representation.
-Art.16(4) existed from the start of the Constitution and was meant as a temporary measure. Art.15(4) came as a response to Champakai Durai Rajan case where TN reserved seats for SC and it was struck down because it was found in violation of Art.14 & 15.

Specific questions to be answered:
1. How do you determine backwardness and what are its indicators?
2. Are such affirmative action measures an exception to the general rule of non-discrimination or in furtherance of non-discrimination?

How do you determine backwardness and what are its indicators?

Cases
MR Balaji v State of Mysore(1963)
-Issue: whether caste can be the sole indicator of backwardness?
-The court said caste can be a relevant factor but it cannot be the sole factor for SEBC. Other factors can be poverty, occupation, location.

R. Chitralekha v State of Mysore
-The parameters for defining backwardness were economic condition and occuopation.
-

Two cases decided in the same year differed on whether caste can be used to primarily decide backwardness:
P Rajendran v State of Madras
-Test of backwardness predominantly based on caste. It was accepted.
State of AP v P Sagar
-Test of backwardness predominantly based on caste. It was rejected.

1.2.21

-A committee was appointed in the 50s headed by Babasaheb Kalelkar. It made a report that was to determine the factors of backwardness, which was primarily focused on caste. Nehru categorically rejected this report as he wanted it to be more multi-faceted in its accounting of backwardness. This could be seen as a way to secularise the understanding of backwardness.
-In NM Thomas, Nehru's view was challenged as the court said that caste could be counted as the sole determinant of backwardness.
-Jayashree v State of Kerala was a case that reiterated the stand of NM Thomas.
-KC Vasanth Kumar v State of Karnataka(1985): The five judges gave different criteria for backwardness:
    1.CJI Chandrachud said that person would be considered backward only if their backwardness is conmparable to SC/ST. Secondly, that they must meet a laid down economic criterion.
    2.Justice Desai said that the only criteria for determining backwardness is economic.
    3.Justice Chinappa Reddy said that the primary factor is class poverty among other relevant like caste, occupation etc.
    4.Justice Sen said that the predominant factor should be poverty. Caste is only a factor to determine the Chandrachud test.
    5.Justice Venkataramaiah said that there were three main factors for determining backwardness is caste, economic standing and occupation.
The ratio of this case is nothing.
-The above case is why Indra Sawhney was need soon because this case was too divided in the opinions offered.

Are such affirmative action measures an exception to the general rule of non-discrimination or in furtherance of non-discrimination?

-In MR Balaji the rationale for not letting reservations exceed 50% is that the exception is becoming the rule in that case.
-Carry Forward Rule: TN had a 17.5% reservation. However, if some seats are unfilled those unfilled reserved seats would be added to the pool of reserved seats in the next year.
-In Devdasan v. UOI, it was said by the majority that Carry Forward itself was unconstitutional as voiced by Mudholkar. However, Subba Rao dissented and said that Carry Forward itself was not unconstitutional but, such amount of reserved seats could not exceed 50%.
-The stance is changed in NM Thomas where reservation is seen as furthering equality and Krishna Iyer said that it was an emphatic assertion of equality.

General Manager, Southern Railways v S. Rangachari
-The issue was whether reservations could be implemented in promotions.
-The court said that reservations could also exist in promotions.
-The rationale was that a person from a backward class/caste would be able to find a job, but promotions would be monopolised by the upper caste.
-Thus, the fear was that the office dynamics would become pyramid shaped, with the upper castes perched at the top and this would just recreate existing social dynamics of discrimination in the office.

2.12.21

-The 2nd Backward Classes Commission in the year 1979 under BP Mandal, this is known as the Mandal Commission.
-This commission too submitted a report that primarily focused on caste as a determinant of backwardness.
-However, this time the perspective on backwardness had changed a lot from the time of the first commission. This was due to the judicial uncertainty as to the factors of backwardness and NM Thomas.
-The list for backward classes was based on the 1931 census and it was recommended that 27% reservation be given in central and state employment along with educational institutions.
-The report came out in 1980. Because a person's caste had more weightage than economic and educational indicators. Since, caste had more weightage, this list became almost a list of backward castes instead of backward classes.

-VP Singh was the one of the first to camopaign with the promise to essentially implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission.
-However, the plan was to allow states to form their own list of backward classes. This meant that if some backward classes were included in the state list but not in the central list, in that state they would get all the benefits of reservation. If a backward class was in the central list, but not the state list, they would get the benefits of reservation in central services throughout India.
-This meant that effectively, the reservation was 49.5% on paper, but effectively it could cross 50% depending on how the state list is.

-PV Narasimha Rao passed an office memorandum on 25.9.1991 saying that:
	1.In the 27% reservation, preference is to be given to the poorer of the backward classes.
	2.Another 10% reservation which is to be given to economically weaker sections of society.
-Thus, this again breaches the 50% ceiling on reservation even though it isn't really relevant anymore.

Indra Sawhney case
-Justice Jeevan Reddy said that the criteria of the reservation scheme was fine being dominantly based on caste as the Mandal Commission had also considered other factors.
-He also said that reservation was in furtherance of equality but it should not breach 50% in ordinary circumstances. But, if there is a remote region where the population is 90% SC, then the scheme of reservation could be altered for that region.
-However, it was said that the most critical services that required the highest skill and calibre and administrative efficiency would be exempt from reservation. This clearly shows that reservation was seen as something that compromised merit and efficiency. It was also said that reservation would not be allowed in the judiciary, armed forces, nuclear research, defence production, technical posts including R&D jobs etc.

3.2.21

-Art. 16(4A) was brought in by way of an amendment that explicitly nullified Indra Sawhney and allowed reservation in promotion.
-Ajit Singh Januja (1 & 2), Virpal Singh Chauhan were a couple of cases that dealt with a peculiar thing: the question of seniority. Lets say that A joins on 1.1.20 and is from the General category and B joins on 2.1.20 and is from the SC category. B gets promoted on 1.1.21 and A gets promoted on 2.1.21.
-There are two rules deciding seniority:
	1. Consequential Seniority - When a person gets promoted even though he joined later, he would be considered senior to all those who were promoted after him. Thus, seniority depends on the date of promotion.
	2. Catch up Rule - This rule says that if someone who joined later gets promoted before someone who joined earlier, the person who joined earlier would regain his seniority when he gets promoted to the same level. Thus, seniority depends on the date of joining.
-Thus, in both these cases it was said that consequential seniority could not be applied and the Catch up Rule would have to be followed.

-S Vinod Kumar v Union of India: Kumar argued that lowering of qualifying marks would have a detrimental effect on the administrative efficiency of the sevice so affected. There is also Art.335 which stated that reservation should not negatively impact administrative efficiency. Thus, the court said that there would be no relaxation in qualifying marks.

-Art.16(4B) is inserted via the 82nd amendment that states that reserved seats can be carried over to the next year, going against Devdasan.
-Art.335 was amended by the 82nd amendment to state that relaxation in qualifying marks would be allowed, going against S Vinod Kumar.
-Art.16(4A) is amended via the 85th amendment to allow for the implementation of consequential seniority in employment, going against Ajit Singh Januja (1 & 2) and Virpal Singh Chauhan.

5.2.21

A lot of project discussion.

8.2.21

M.Nagaraj & Others vs Union Of India & Others(19.10.06)
-The state has to prove through quantifiable data the following before granting reservation in promotion according to Justice Kapadia:

	1.Demonstrate the backwardness of the SC/STs.
	2.Prove that the SC/ST is inadequately represented in relevant public employment.
	3.Maintain the overall efficiency of administration.

-The adequate representation is to be calculated by the government and approved by the court.
-This followed the Cumulative Adequacy position where all tiers of employment was supposed to have adequate requirement.

UP Power Corporation vs. Rajesh Kumar
-Rajesh Kumar challenged reservation in promotion based on Nagaraj.
-The court struck it down.
-There was widespread furore in the country.
-Because of this, the government brought forward the 117th constitutional amendment that legalised reservation in promotion with consequential seniority.
-The Bill failed, but it demonstrated that the state finally realised that Nagaraj was a Frankenstein that needed to be put down.

Jarnail Singh v. Lakshmi Narayan Gupta
-The primary question was whether the three points laid down in Nagaraj was valid.
-The 5 judge bench led by Justice Rohintan Nariman said Nagaraj did not need to be reviewed.
-It also said that Nagaraj did not overrule Indra Sawhney. The court said that Nagaraj was dealing with amendments that were brought into force after Indra Sawhney and thus, was dealing with a new situation that was not even possible after Indra Sawhney. 
-However, it did say that the first point laid down in Nagaraj would be rejected.
-But, it also said that creamy layer can be implemented for reservation in promotion.
-This may lead to the same problem of the upper tiers of employment being dominated by the upper castes as the salary at those levels would by itself make a SC/ST candidate part of the creamy layer.

BK Pavitra 1
-It struck down the reservation law brought about by the Karnataka government in promotions.
-After the first BK Pavitra judgement the Karnataka government made a committee to quantify backwardness. This committee was called the Ratna Prabha committee.
-This committee was supposed to provide the Karnataka government with data to back up their reservation scheme.
-The law was again revived based on the committee report.

BK Pavitra 2
-The law was challenged again in the SC.
-The arguments were that
	1.It was a legislative overruling of the BK Pavitra 1 judgement.
	2.There is consequential seniority and creamy layer was not part of the scheme.
-Justice Chandrachud said that it was not a legislative overruling. The court can only have limited oversight over the committee. It was also an expert committee that used methods commonly accepted in the field, the court was satisfied with it.
-Chandrachud says that for consequential seniority there is no requirement for satisfying creamy layer as Jarnail Singh was only about reservation in promotion.

9.2.21

EV Chinniah v State of Andhra Pradesh
-A law in AP had made sub-classifications within SCs designating some SCs as more backward than others.
-The court said that this cannot be done because SCs are homogeneously backwards.

State of Punjab v Davinder Singh
-There was a Punjab law that made sub-classifications within SCs that said 50% of the SC seats would be reserved for Valmiki and Mazhavi Sikhs.
-The court thought that it needed to be considered by a larger bench.
-So, the case was referred to a 5 judge bench. Justice Arun Mishra severely criticised EV Chinnaiah. The case was then referred it to an even bigger 11 judge bench.
-The judgement from the 11 judge bench is still pending but, it looks like EV Chinnaiah will probably be overturned along with some reconsideration of Indra Sawhney.

Read: https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2020/09/04/guest-post-sub-classification-in-reservations-ii/

-There were 3 judgements between 2002-2005 that struck down the attempts by state governments to bring in reservation in private entities.
-The 3 cases were:
	1.TMA Pai Foundation v UOI 2002
	2.Islamic Academy v UOI 2003
	3.PA Inamdar v State of Maharashtra 2005
-All of these reservations were struck down under Article 19(1)(g).
-Then, Article 15(5)  was introduced via the 93rd constitutional amendment in response to these judgements. It says:

	Nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 shall prevent the State from making any special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in so far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30.
-Clearly intended to overrule the 3 SC judgements.

Ashoka Kumar Thakur v Union of India
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka_Kumar_Thakur_v._Union_of_India
-Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 was brought in to ensure reservations in Central educational institutes.
-This law was challenged on the basis of BS and Article 19(1)(g).
-CJI Balakrishnan said that since this law does not deal with reservation in private institutions, the court would not look at this with respect to private institutions.
-This can be problematic because this law could be a model for further laws that reserve seats in private institutes. This leads to a split in Basic Structure scrutiny which is supposed to be all encompassing.
-The SC upheld both the constitutional amendment and the law. They said that the 93rd amendment did not violate the BS so far as it concerned state insitutions and thus, partially upheld Article 15(5).

-The question that was left unanswered was whether reservations can be imposed in private, unaided educational insitutions.
-This question came to the fore after Article 21A and the RTE, which mandated that seats be reserved even in private, unaided schools.

Society for Unaided Private Schools, Rajasthan v UOI
-When the RTE Act was challenged, the law was upheld.
-Only minority educational institutions were excluded as they enjoyed a special constitutional position.
-As such, Article 21A itself was not challenged in this case.

Pramati Education Trust v UOI
-However, in this case the 86th consitutional amendment which brought Article 21A into existence was challenged. The inclusion of private schools under the RTE Act was also challenged.
-The five judge bench in this case unanimously upheld it all. Neither, Article 15(5) nor 21A was in violation of the BS.
-Thus, it is now completely valid to have reservation in private, unaided educational institutions.

-The 103rd constitutional amendment brought in the EWS reservation. Since, this one is brought in as a constitutional amendment it will be subjected to a BS scrutiny unlike the office memorandum one in the 90s.

10.2.21

ARTICLE 19 - FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

-Can companies in India have Article 19(1)(a) right? RC Cooper said the aggregation of the Article 19(1)(a) rights of all the people in the organisation is the Article 19(1)(a) right of the organisation itself.
-This rationale was extended to media companies in Bennett Coleman & Co. v. Union of India. The Article 19(1)(a) right of a newspaper, TV channel etc when violated is actually the violation of the Article 19(1)(a) rights of its, audience, employees and others, as represented by that media company.

12.2.21

Article 19(2)
-Acts as a restriction on freedom of speech and expression to protect public and private interests.
-Allows the government to take steps to curb free speech. The question is whether such limits are reasonable or not.
-The yardstick for reasonable restriction shifts from time to time, from generation to generation.
-Devidas Ramachandra Tuljapurkar v State of Maharashtra: Someone wrote a nasty poem against Mahatma Gandhi. The state prosecuted the person for obscenity. Justice Dipak Mishra said that one must be careful when criticising "historically respected persons". This classification of "historically respected persons" was brought about out of thin air and there is no clarity as to who belongs in this category.
-Bijoe Emmanuel v State of Kerala: 3 kids did not sing the national anthem because it went against their religious beliefs as part of Jehovah's Witnesses. They stood silent during the assembly and for this they were expelled from the school. The SC said that there was no law itself that mandated the singing of the national anthem but it was instead done by an office order of the Department of Education in Kerala. The SC ruled that the expulsion of the kids violated their rights to freedom of speech and expression and right to freedom of religion.

15.2.21

-The restriction on Article 19(1) has to  fall on one of these grounds:
	1.It has to be brought about by means of a law.
	2.The grounds mentioned in Article 19(2).

The evolution of Article 19(2)
-The first difference that we can see in the original Article 19(2) is that it did not have public order. Instead, it had the restriction that if your speech undermined the security of the state or tending to overthrow the state.
-Incitement to offence was also not part of Article 19(2).
-Restrictions on freedom of speech and expression did not have to be "reasonable".
-There were two periodicals that caught the ire of the government.
	1.Crossroads was a periodical that was published by the communist party, whose editor was Romesh Thapar the brother of the Romila Thapar. It was highly critical of Nehru's foreign policy and there would be strikes and protests whenever a new issue came out. The state of Madras invoked the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1949 to ban the circulation, distribution and sale of the periodical. This was done in the interest of public order even though it was not a ground under the original Article 19(2).
	2.The Organiser was the mouthpiece of the RSS and SP Mookherjee criticised the pact between India and Pakistan about the settlement of refugees. The Punjab government brought about the Public Safety Act, 1959 to similarly ban the Organiser for the benefit of public order.
-The two cases dealing with these bans were Romesh Thappar vs State of Madras and Brij Bhushan vs State of Delhi. The majority judgement was delivered by Patanjali Shastri and in both these cases struck down the restrictions. They said that the restrictions could not be sustained as public order was not a ground under the original Article 19(2) and the standard of undermined the security of the state or tending to overthrow the state was much higher. So, unless your speech was literally fomenting a civil war, it could not qualify to be restricted. Fazl Ali said that the state should be able to decide at what stage it counted as going against the state as under the original Article 19(2) as part of its sovereign prerogative. Fazl Ali said that the distincition between public order and public safety is quite flimsy.
-State of Bihar v Shailabala Devi 1950: Devi owned a printing press that had brought out a Bengali leaflet called Sangram, that included a dialogue between Maa Kali who said I am the bloodhtirsty goddess who yearns for revolution against the shackles. Bihar restricted this leaflet for inciting violence against the state. Justice Sharju Prasad said:
	“if a person were to go on inciting murder or other cognisable offences either through the press or by word of mouth, he would be free to do so with impunity” as “he would claim the privilege of exercising his fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression”
-As a response to these three judgements, the first constitutional amendment was brought about.
-Nehru was about to leave for Lusaka when he was beseeched by Sardar Patel in the form of a letter who urged Nehru to consider constitutional amendments to curb free speech and strenghten press control laws.
-This amendment brought about some changes to the original Article 19(2):
	1.Standard was lowered from basically sedition to public order.
	2.Incitement to offence was also brought in.
	3.At the behest of Ambedkar, the word "reasonable" was also inserted so as to rein in the power of the state.

-Can politicians say they have a right not to speak? Yes, but this right is counterbalanced by the right to be informed of the electorate which is part of their right to freedom of speech and expression. As a vote is an expression, it has to be based on correct, timely information.
