Immovable property under Section 3
-Fish in water is immovable property. However, when fish are moved out of the water, so it is no longer attached to the water body, it becomes movable property.
-A Right, such as a Right to Ferry or Right to catch fish is immovable property because it is tied to a static property.
-Cases:
	1.Bihar Fisherman Co-operative Society Sipahi Singh AIR 1977 SC 2149: SC held that Right to catch fish is immovable property.

Notice
-Notice is knowledge or presumed knowledge of a state of being or an occurence. There is some burden to conduct a proper search or research about the fact in question.

7.1.21

-Muhammad Mustafa v Haji Muhammad AIR 1987 Patna 5: The court in this case held that the person who purchased a property does not need to make an enquiry about all the previous transactions. The principle of constructive notice cannot be stretched beyond a certain limit. Ownership can be verified in two ways, verifying possession and verifying the title. Such verification should abide by the standard of reasonable care and caution instead of being an accounting of the whole history of the property.
-Kalyani v Krishnan Nambiar AIR 1932 Madras 305: 
-Example: A sold a house to B but continues to live in the house. The sale deed is also not registered. Then, A sold the house again to C. Here, C reasonably believes that A is still the rightful owner because the sale deed was not yet registered.

11.1.21

What is Transfer? (Section 5)
-A and B both claim a property. B relinquishes his claim on the property in exchange for ₹500. Is this a transfer? In Moti Singh v Devi Charan the SC said that partition is not a transfer.
-Is the creation of charge, such as a debenture, a transfer of property? It is not becaause when a charge is created it is only done to secure payment on a personal obligation.

14.1.21

-A being the owner of the house is the larger interest owner compared to B who is a tenant and the lesser interest owner. So, the tenant leaving is not transfer under Section 5.
-In case of a partition, it is not a transfer of property. In a number of cases, courts have argued that it is process to transform a joint enjoyment into a personal enjoyment. There is no conveyance thus, no transfer.

-A makes a gift deed to B but does not mention when the deed will be executed. If no time is specified then B will gain a vested interest from the day the deed was made.
-A makes a gift deed to B which B will get on the death of C. This will be a vested interest for B as the death of C is a certainty.

Kokilambal v N Raman Kokilambal AIR 2005 SC 2468
Rajesh Kanta Roy v Srimati Santi Debi AIR 1957 SC 255

-A transferred certain properties to B which are to be gained by B after attaining the age of majority. This is a vested interest. However, if the condition is that B gets it at 25 years, this condition will be void.

1.2.21

Kokilambal v N Raman Kokilambal: A had transferred the accumulation rights and some alienation rights over it to B as part of a family settlement. B had died, so C was now given the property by A. However, B's brother contested that the property had vested in B and thus, A had no right to transfer the property anymore.
-A had only created limited interest in B's favour.
-The property was supposed to vest in B after A's death. But, B died before A.
-The question was whether the particular property vested in B or not?
-Since, only limited rights were transferred to B and it was a family settlement, the claim by B's brother was disallowed. B died with a limited interest and thus, the property didn't vest in him. Thus, the transfer of the property to C is valid.

2.2.21

-A transfers a house to B with the condition that if B doesn't take possession by 6 months, the property will pass to C. This condition flows out of Section 28. This is a vested interest.
-Thus, this condition of 6 months is not for the vesting of the property in B, but rather the divesting of the property from B.
Rajesh Kanta Roy v Srimati Santi Debi:
-A transferred a property by trust deed with the condition that the trust would be dissolved after the loans he had incurred were paid off as that was the purpose of the trust or if A died. After the dissolution of the trust the property was supposed to pass to his two sons, S1 and S2. If the sons died, the legal heirs of the son would get the property. However, A died before the the loan could be discharged. The question before the court was whether the interest created in favour of the two sons was vested or contingent.
-The vesting of the property was not postponed. The income arising from the property was burdened with the obligation to pay back the debt.

4.2.21

Kannappa Chettiar v. Kupuswamy Naidu, AIR 1975 Mad 256
-A executed a deed of settlement. The daughter B was given a life interest and her legal heirs would get a vested interest. If B died before she had any children, the property would pass to C, the son. However, A made a new deed after this where he passed an abolute interest to B instead of a life interest. C sues because the contention is that whether A is competent to execute the second deed at all.
-The court said that A has no further interest in the property to enable him to execute another deed to give the property away. B already holds the life interest and the contingent interest would flow to C in the form of an absolute interst if B dies with no children.

Namburi Basava Subhramanayam v Alapati Hymavathi - AIR 1996 SC 2220
-A has some property and makes a settlement deed in favour of his daughters D1 and D2. D1 died and he revoked the deed and gave all the property to the surviving daughter D2. Then, the legal heirs of D1 challenged the validity of his second transfer.

8.2.21

Section 25

-The legal effect of transfer may vary according to the nature of the condition attached to it.
-Conditions can be of 3 types:
	1.Condition precedent - A condition where you have to fulfill the condition for the transfer to happen.
	2.Condition subsequent - A condition which has to be fulfilled after the transfer.
	3.Collateral condition - Creation of the interest in the property and the fulfillment of the condition happen simultaneously.
-If A takes a loan from C and fails to pay back, A's property can be attached to pay that amount back. If A has transferred his property to B, it cannot be attached for this transaction. However, if it can be proved that A transferred it to B just to frustrate the legal proceeding against him, it can be attached and the transfer to B will be held to be void.
-A leased his property to B so long as B stays in A's house. This is a collateral conditon and is perfectly valid.

9.2.21

Section 26 - Just read it.
-The broader position of law is to ensure justice. The concept of justice itself is a developing one. So, one has to use one's judicious mind to determine the most just path.

Ulterior disposition
-Used in a layman sense in Section 27. A latent transfer that is triggered upon a specific condition.

11.2.21

Section 27
-Deals with second transfer on failure of first. This is a conditional transfer.
-The second transfer is the ulterior disposition. The first transfer is the prior disposition.

-A transfers property to B with the condition that he will open a shop  within 3 years of receiving the property or the property will pass to C. B dies before setiing up the shop. The property will still pass to C even though the condition was not exactly contemplated by A.
-A transfers property to his wife, W, with the condition that if she should die in his lifetime, the property will pass to C. If both A and W die in a plane crash such that it is impossible to say who died first, the property should not pass to B.


Section 28
-Deals with conditional limitation.
-Conditional limitation is a condition which divests an interest and subsequently vests it in another person.
-A transfers certain property to B with a condition that B must go to England within 3 years. If B fails to go to England then the property will go to C.

15.2.21

Section 32
-Deals with condition subsequent which is void.
-Any condition for ulterior disposition must be legally valid.
-Any condition subsequent which intends to divest interest in any property will not take place if the condition is invalid.
-A transfers property to B with a condition that B should not set fire to the haystack. If he sets fire to the haystack it will go to C. Even if B burns the haystack, the property will not divest.
-A transfers property to B with the condition that B should not desert her husband within a period of 1 year. If she does, then the property goes to C. Even if she deserts her husband, the property will not divest.

Section 33
-A transfers property to B with the condition that B must join the army, if B does not the property will go to C. B started a business in the meantime and did not join the army. Thus, the property will divest immediately to C when B starts a business.

Section 34
-A transfers property to B with a condition that if B doesn't live in Benaras for 3 months from the date of transfer, the property will go to C. If the relatives of C confined B for 3 months so that he was unable to live in Benaras, the property will not pass to C.

18.2.21

Section 35
What is election?
This is not mentioned it Section 35 but it incorporates election. Election simply means choosing one between two contradicting or alternative rights or interests.
35. Election when necessary.—Where a person professes to transfer property which he has no right to transfer, and as part of the same transaction confers any benefit on the owner of the property, such owner must elect either to confirm such transfer or to dissent from it; and in the latter case he shall relinquish the benefit so conferred, and the benefit so relinquished shall revert to the transferor or his representative as if it had not been disposed of, subject nevertheless, where the transfer is gratuitous, and the transferor has, before the election, died or otherwise become incapable of making a fresh transfer, and in all cases where the transfer is for consideration, to the charge of making good to the disappointed transferee the amount or value of the property attempted to be transferred to him. Illustrations The farm of Sultanpur is the property of C and worth Rs. 800. A by an instrument of gift professes to transfer it to B, giving by the same instrument Rs. 1,000 to C. C elects to retain the farm. He forfeits the gift of Rs. 1,000. In the same case, A dies before the election. His representative must out of the Rs. 1,000 pay Rs. 800 to B. The rule in the first paragraph of this section applies whether the transferor does or does not believe that which he professes to transfer to be his own. A person taking no benefit directly under a transaction, but deriving a benefit under it indirectly, need not elect. A person who in his one capacity takes a benefit under the transaction may in another dissent therefrom. 
Exception to the last preceding four rules.—Where a particular benefit is expressed to be conferred on the owner of the property which the transferor professes to transfer, and such benefit is expressed to be in lieu of that property, if such owner claims the property, he must relinquish the particular benefit, but he is not bound to relinquish any other benefit conferred upon him by the same transaction. Acceptance of the benefit by the person on whom it is conferred constitutes an election by him to confirm the transfer, if he is aware of his duty to elect and of those circumstances which would influence the judgment of a reasonable man in making an election, or if he waives enquiry into the circumstances. Such knowledge or waiver shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed, if the person on whom the benefit has been conferred has enjoyed it for two years without doing any act to express dissent. Such knowledge or waiver may be inferred from any act of his which renders it impossible to place the persons interested in the property professed to be transferred in the same condition as if such act had not been done. 
Illustration 
A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal-mine. C takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He has thereby confirmed the transfer of the estate to B. If he does not within one year after the date of the transfer signify to the transferor or his representatives his intention to confirm or to dissent from the transfer, the transferor or his representative may, upon the expiration of that period, require him to make his election; and, if he does not comply with such requisition within a reasonable time after he has received it, he shall be deemed to have elected to confirm the transfer. In case of disability, the election shall be postponed until the disability ceases, or until the election is made by some competent authority. 
COMMENTS 
When question of election arises A case of election arises only when the transferee takes a benefit directly under a transaction. When the transferee derives any benefit indirectly, no question of election arises, as he, in that case, cannot be said to take under the deed; Valliammai v. Nagappa, AIR 1967 SC 1153.

Beepathumma v. S V Kadambolithya AIR 1965 SC 241
In this case it was held that a person can't take under and against the same instrument, or otherwise, no one can approbate and reprobate at the same time. The latter line has been taken from an English case Coddington v Lindsay.
Why does a person profess to transfer a property not their own? If we look into the statute under person who can transfer, a person can transfer one's own property or a person who has the authority to transfer. In these cases the provision is not applicable. However, a person may transfer certain property either because of his ignorance or misunderstanding of the ownership of the property or may have Express or implied authority by the owner to do so. Ignorance is not tenable especially in the present day.
However, the authority part is very important. Express authority is an authority expressly given, in this case to sell the property. Implied authority is when the person has approved of the transfer who has an actual authority. For example, when one transfers a property not of their own in presence of the original owner and the latter had every opportunity to challenge the transfer as in was free from undue influence, coercion, etc and was given some benefit under the transfer document as well , the latter may choose whether they should challenge the transfer or take the benefit under the transfer document. 
This is also under doctrine of estoppel where the owner once accepts the transfer cannot later deny its validity. 
The situation where one transfers a property not his own arises in the case of a will, because the transfer ebecomes valid only after the death of the testator. So if I transfer a property I have been bequeathed in the will during the lifetime of the transferor, I am transferring a property not my own. If alongside the transfer I give the testator some benefit, he is under an ibli
White and Tudor's Leading Cases in Equity (book) : election is an obligation imposed upon a party by courts of equity to choose between two contradicting rights or claims in case where there is a clear intention that he should not enjoy both. He who enjoys a benefit under a deed or will must adopt the whole contents of the document. 
Section 35 by applying the principle of equity says that if you accept the benefit out of a transaction you must accept the transaction. 
If this principle is not there, people will accept the benefit only and challenge the transfer. This goes against the principle of equity. Thus, the court of equity developed the principle which has been codified under Section 35.
A gifted some money to B. In lieu of that, B is required to transfer his house to A. If A refuses to transfer the house B has to also refuse the money. This is election. The law says of you take the benefit you must fulfill the obligation. 
A makes a gift deed of Rs 1000 with a condition that B must transfer property to C. Here B must choose between the gift and the property not being transferred. In the language of law, B has been put to election. It is an equitable principle under which a person may not be allowed to approve only that part of the instrument which is beneficial to him and disapprove of another part of the instrument which is contradictory to his interest. 
Ramayya v. Mahalaxmi AIR 1922 Mad 357
Deputy Commissioner v. Ram Swarup (1917) OC 243
There are 3 essential conditions under Section 35:
1. A person must profess to transfer a property not their own. 
2. A part of the transaction confers a benefit to the actual owner of the property. 
3. Both the transfer of the property and the benefit must be in the same transaction/instrument. 
Under these conditions the doctrine of election will arise. 
The requirement that it must be put of the same transaction is quite important. If there is no transfer and interest in the same instrument, the doctrine of election will not apply, per Ramaiya v Mahalaxmi
If the transfer and the benefit are inseparable and interdependent, they form part of the same transaction. The transfer of property is to be made only in lieu of the benefit. 
If the transfer and benefit are independent, the doctrine of election doesn't apply. There is no election of the two are independent transactions.

Son of W, M, raised objection to this sale, saying it was willed to him by A and the mother couldn't transfer it as she was just the benami figurehead of the land and not the actual owner.
-The Calcutta HC decided this case in favour of the son. So, R went on appeal to the Privy Council.
-The Privy Council overturned the HC judgement and awarded the land to R.

Jaydayal Poddar (Deceased) v Mst. Bibi Hazra And Ors on 19 October, 1973
-This case laid down some important factors to consider in case of benami transactions:
	1. the burden of showing that a transfer is a benami transaction lies on the person who asserts that it is such a transaction;  

	2. it is proved that the purchase money came from a person other than the person in whose favor the property is transferred, the purchase is prima facie assumed to be for the benefit of the person who supplied the purchase money, unless there is evidence to the contrary;  

	3. the true character of the transaction is governed by the intention of the person who has contributed the purchase money and  

	4. the question as to what his intention was has to be decided on the basis of the surrounding circumstances, the relationship of the parties, the motives governing their action in bringing about the transaction and their subsequent conduct, etc.
