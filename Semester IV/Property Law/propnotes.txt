4.1.21

Immovable property under Section 3
-Fish in water is immovable property. However, when fish are moved out of the water, so it is no longer attached to the water body, it becomes movable property.
-A Right, such as a Right to Ferry or Right to catch fish is immovable property because it is tied to a static property.
-Cases:
	1.Bihar Fisherman Co-operative Society Sipahi Singh AIR 1977 SC 2149: SC held that Right to catch fish is immovable property.
	2.Moti Singh v. Deoki Singh AIR 1936, Pat 46: Crops are movable property, but right to grow crops is immovable property.

-Lloyds Bank v P.F. Guzder & Co. AIR 1930 Cal 22

7.1.21

-Muhammad Mustafa v Haji Muhammad AIR 1987 Patna 5: The court in this case held that the person who purchased a property does not need to make an enquiry about all the previous transactions. The principle of constructive notice cannot be stretched beyond a certain limit. Ownership can be verified in two ways, verifying possession and verifying the title. Such verification should abide by the standard of reasonable care and caution instead of being an accounting of the whole history of the property.
-Kalyani v Krishnan Nambiar AIR 1932 Madras 305: 
-Example: A sold a house to B but continues to live in the house. The sale deed is also not registered. Then, A sold the house again to C. Here, C reasonably believes that A is still the rightful owner because the sale deed was not yet registered.

Secretary of State v. Dattatreya, (1901)3 Bom. LR 923

11.1.21

What is Transfer? (Section 5)
-A and B both claim a property. B relinquishes his claim on the property in exchange for â‚¹500. Is this a transfer? In Moti Singh v Devi Charan the SC said that partition is not a transfer.
-Is the creation of charge, such as a debenture, a transfer of property? It is not becaause when a charge is created it is only done to secure payment on a personal obligation.

14.1.21

-A being the owner of the house is the larger interest owner compared to B who is a tenant and the lesser interest owner. So, the tenant leaving is not transfer under Section 5.
-In case of a partition, it is not a transfer of property. In a number of cases, courts have argued that it is process to transform a joint enjoyment into a personal enjoyment. There is no conveyance thus, no transfer.

18.1.21

What may be transferred?(Section 6)
Just read the section
-Section 6(h)(1) is like when one is attempting to sell the right to light above a piece of land without transferring the land itself.

29.1.21

Sections 19 and 21 (Vested and Contingent interest)
-A makes a gift deed to B but does not mention when the deed will be executed. If no time is specified then B will gain a vested interest from the day the deed was made.
-A makes a gift deed to B which B will get on the death of C. This will be a vested interest for B as the death of C is a certainty.

Sew Dayal v Official Trustee AIR 1931 Cal 651
Kokilambal v N Raman Kokilambal AIR 2005 SC 2468
Rajesh Kanta Roy v Srimati Santi Debi AIR 1957 SC 255

-A transferred certain properties to B which are to be gained by B after attaining the age of majority. This is a vested interest. However, if the condition is that B gets it at 25 years, this condition will be void.

1.2.21

Kokilambal v N Raman Kokilambal: A had transferred the accumulation rights and some alienation rights over it to B as part of a family settlement. B had died, so C was now given the property by A. However, B's brother contested that the property had vested in B and thus, A had no right to transfer the property anymore.
-A had only created limited interest in B's favour.
-The property was supposed to vest in B after A's death. But, B died before A.
-The question was whether the particular property vested in B or not?
-Since, only limited rights were transferred to B and it was a family settlement, the claim by B's brother was disallowed. B died with a limited interest and thus, the property didn't vest in him. Thus, the transfer of the property to C is valid.

2.2.21

-A transfers a house to B with the condition that if B doesn't take possession by 6 months, the property will pass to C. This condition flows out of Section 28. This is a vested interest.
-Thus, this condition of 6 months is not for the vesting of the property in B, but rather the divesting of the property from B.
Rajesh Kanta Roy v Srimati Santi Debi:
-A transferred a property by trust deed with the condition that the trust would be dissolved after the loans he had incurred were paid off as that was the purpose of the trust or if A died. After the dissolution of the trust the property was supposed to pass to his two sons, S1 and S2. If the sons died, the legal heirs of the son would get the property. However, A died before the the loan could be discharged. The question before the court was whether the interest created in favour of the two sons was vested or contingent.
-The vesting of the property was not postponed. The income arising from the property was burdened with the obligation to pay back the debt.

4.2.21

Kannappa Chettiar v. Kupuswamy Naidu, AIR 1975 Mad 256
-A executed a deed of settlement. The daughter B was given a life interest and her legal heirs would get a vested interest. If B died before she had any children, the property would pass to C, the son. However, A made a new deed after this where he passed an abolute interest to B instead of a life interest. C sues because the contention is that whether A is competent to execute the second deed at all.
-The court said that A has no further interest in the property to enable him to execute another deed to give the property away. B already holds the life interest and the contingent interest would flow to C in the form of an absolute interst if B dies with no children.

Namburi Basava Subhramanayam v Alapati Hymavathi - AIR 1996 SC 2220
-A has some property and makes a settlement deed in favour of his daughters D1 and D2. D1 died and he revoked the deed and gave all the property to the surviving daughter D2. Then, the legal heirs of D1 challenged the validity of his second transfer.

8.2.21

Section 25

-The legal effect of transfer may vary according to the nature of the condition attached to it.
-Conditions can be of 3 types:
	1.Condition precedent - A condition where you have to fulfill the condition for the transfer to happen.
	2.Condition subsequent - A condition which has to be fulfilled after the transfer.
	3.Collateral condition - Creation of the interest in the property and the fulfillment of the condition happen simultaneously.
-If A takes a loan from C and fails to pay back, A's property can be attached to pay that amount back. If A has transferred his property to B, it cannot be attached for this transaction. However, if it can be proved that A transferred it to B just to frustrate the legal proceeding against him, it can be attached and the transfer to B will be held to be void.
-A leased his property to B so long as B stays in A's house. This is a collateral conditon and is perfectly valid.

9.2.21

Section 26 - Just read it.
-The broader position of law is to ensure justice. The concept of justice itself is a developing one. So, one has to use one's judicious mind to determine the most just path.

Ulterior disposition
-Used in a layman sense in Section 27. A latent transfer that is triggered upon a specific condition.

11.2.21

Section 27
-Deals with second transfer on failure of first. This is a conditional transfer.
-The second transfer is the ulterior disposition. The first transfer is the prior disposition.

-A transfers property to B with the condition that he will open a shop  within 3 years of receiving the property or the property will pass to C. B dies before setiing up the shop. The property will still pass to C even though the condition was not exactly contemplated by A.
-A transfers property to his wife, W, with the condition that if she should die in his lifetime, the property will pass to C. If both A and W die in a plane crash such that it is impossible to say who died first, the property should not pass to B.


Section 28
-Deals with conditional limitation.
-Conditional limitation is a condition which divests an interest and subsequently vests it in another person.
-A transfers certain property to B with a condition that B must go to England within 3 years. If B fails to go to England then the property will go to C.

15.2.21

Section 32
-Deals with condition subsequent which is void.
-Any condition for ulterior disposition must be legally valid.
-Any condition subsequent which intends to divest interest in any property will not take place if the condition is invalid.
-A transfers property to B with a condition that B should not set fire to the haystack. If he sets fire to the haystack it will go to C. Even if B burns the haystack, the property will not divest.
-A transfers property to B with the condition that B should not desert her husband within a period of 1 year. If she does, then the property goes to C. Even if she deserts her husband, the property will not divest.

Section 33
-A transfers property to B with the condition that B must join the army, if B does not the property will go to C. B started a business in the meantime and did not join the army. Thus, the property will divest immediately to C when B starts a business.

Section 34
-A transfers property to B with a condition that if B doesn't live in Benaras for 3 months from the date of transfer, the property will go to C. If the relatives of C confined B for 3 months so that he was unable to live in Benaras, the property will not pass to C.
