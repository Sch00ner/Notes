Jaswant Singh v. Parkash Kaur (2018) 12 SCC 249
-In this case, since the defendant did not appear the suit was decreed ex parte against the defendant.
-The defendant filed to get the ex parte decree dismissed under Order 9 Rule 13, but did not turn up again as he died. The application was thus, dismissed.
-Now the question is whether the dismissal of the application to get the decree dismissed can be challenged again.
-Yes, the dismissal can also be appealed under Order 43 Rule 1(d) for the application for dismissal to be restored.
-Appeal court restored the application in Order 9 Rule 13.
-HC says dismissal was correct and appeal court was wrong.
-In terms of Section 141 all the procedures in the suit are applicable.

11.2.21 JA Limitation

Section 6
-A minor cannot file a suit because he is not of age yet. So, the limitation period for this minor will only start from the time he becomes a major.
-Section 6 applies only to the suit and application. It is not related to appeals.
-Apart from minors, the insane and the idiot are also covered under this. For them, the time for limitation starts from whenever they have managed to overcome their disability.
-If a minor immediately after becoming a major is afflicted with insanity, he can file the suit after the second disability, the insanity, has ceased.
-However, if there is a gap between the first and second disability, Section 6 will be overruled by Section 9, which says that once the period of limitation has started to run, no subsequent disability can stop this time from running out.
-The legal representative of the disabled person retains the limitation period of the disabled person. So, if a minor dies at 17, the legal representative would avail of the fact that the limitation period starts from the minor's 18th birthday.
-If the legal representative is affected by a disability at the point of death of the original disabled person, the rules for disability under Section 6(1) and (2) will apply to them.

Section 7 - Just read it.
